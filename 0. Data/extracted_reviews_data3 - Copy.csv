https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Le Beau Le Parfum worth it, but not this. Too overhyped. Nothing greater than a Cool Water intense or Eternity Aromatic Essence. The meatriders will love and glaze everything released by the Gaultier. This is yet another sweet, synthetic mess called as ''freshie''. If you insist on coconut, a Cool Water intense will satisfy you and save your bucks, if you insist on Le Beau; just go with the parfum version."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Don’t believe the hype. I have JPG Le Beau Le Parfum and I love it but this one just ain’t it. Smells like a cleaning chemical with a hint of pickle juice. My girlfriend hated it so much I had no choice but to give it away to my cousin smh. Get Le Parfum instead
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It has coconut in the opening , then is becomes a GREEN NOTES heavy fragrance . Identical with Kenzo Homme Intense but with the added coconut. It mixes sweet with green and i personally love it!!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I blind bought this because of the hype, and I can say it does live up to the hype, but not fully. There is a certain marine note that although I like, gets kinda annoying after some time, and the coconut feels to synthetic. Still a compliment bomb and a great safe blind buy. 8/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Le Beau Paradise Garden is THE fragrance for a tropical country. Its a literal coconut bomb that is very inoffensive and almost gourmand in how it smells like a freshly opened coconut. In my opinion the scent is pretty linear, with the coconut being the main show for the entire lifespan of the fragrance. The green notes and slight hint of aquatics are also there to add further depth. Performance is superb for a relatively fresh fragrance. People still comment on how I smell 5 hours from application. The smell lingers on my skin for the next 10 hours.Scent: 10/10Longevity: 8/10Projection and Sillage: 9/10"

Dont recommend paying full price.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This fragrance is meh. i would say the opening is a very strong coconut smell which is the thing I don't like about it. But then the base notes are very nice. My friend has this fragrance, which smells good on him. I think about my friend when I smell this. Very nice for the summer and winter. I'm not too fond of the coconut smell tho."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"When i say this stuff last i mean this stuff LASTS. I sprayed 2 or 3 sprays on my hoodie and left it in my car, 6 days later when i remembered where i left it the smell was still there and strong. The opening is a little harsh but the dry down is a milky coconut mixed with mint and a very small touch of fig. It’s a perfect tropical smell and i LOVE it. 10/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"An Addicting smell, huge compliment puller, and a perfect summer scent. The opening is just so special and this thing projects like a beast and lasts pretty long. I've had people tell me 90% of the time its their favorite out of my 18 fragrances I own. I can see how people would say it smells too synthetic... to me its the perfect balance, and it smells perfect. Even if you're not buying this, sample it! It's just so good. Worth a sniff..."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I'm not a fan. To me it smells too synthetic and cheap, and overall I don't find it particularly pleasant. The performance is out of control. This has to be the most nuclear and persistent fragrance I have ever dealt with. One spray and everyone in the city will know you have arrived, so be careful. Ultra unsafe blind buy. Test first, I'm telling you. Tropical fragrances are the new thing, apparently, so there are options. Test and shop around."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Reminds me of Le Beau Le Parfum but fresher, just a bit green and not as sweet but still on the sweet side, idk how it compares to Le Beau EDT since i never tried it, it has great longevity on both skin and clothes at least for me, projection and sillage moderate to strong i'd say, i can see it being used in the winter/fall as well because of the sweetness, it leans more male but can be used by a woman too, for the 70 euros/78 dollars (75ml) i spent on it i'm satisfied."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,It just smells like the other Le Beau’s after it starts to dry down
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,nice
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Maybe my nose is broken but this smells very similar to the other le beaus just slightly green in the opening.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Fresher and very Sandalwood heavy on my skin. Similar to the other flankers otherwise. Very nice fragrance, but IMO not worth retail. I'd wait for discounters. I paid $110 no tax for a 4.2oz bottle and felt like i overpaid even though this is not a bad price for designers these days ($137 Retail). I'd personally pull the trigger at $80ish if it gets that low.Green, Coconutty, Figs, Zinginess from the Ginger, and very prominent Woods opening. I like the drydown way more than the opening. I don't get a strong Tonka-like root beer quality at all. If i imagine really hard, I get a beachy salty skin smell but could not recognize it on my own. Though i like the scent more in the drydown, I feel like it weakens a lot as it starts to dry down as well as getting slightly sweeter on my skin.Overall a pretty solid release. I like it better than the other two flankers. I make all these observations to give others a better picutre and not because i don't like it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Overall, it's good, maybe better than the other le beau. I would describe the opening as removing the incense from adg profondo and adding phylosycos to it. Green, watery, coconutty. As it dries down, it's a little hard to describe, kind of spicy, juicy; then back to green, kinda sweet. Overall, pleasant and definitely unique. Lasts around 4 to 5 hours, which is meh but what can you do. Definitely don't blind buy though, it's extremely hyped relative to how subjective it smells from person to person. Also, it's important to say that the fig note, which is one of my favorites, lasts very very little.Edit: yesterday a girl tracked me in a room full of people to tell me that I smell great."

All I can say is this smells like plastic, like one of those old tupperware containers your parents had for way too long and the plastic starts to stink and it should've been thrown out a long time ago but your parents insists on keeping itWhere's the mint, ginger, fig, watery notes & coconut? Don't smell any of those only smell plastic.Le parfum is still the best of the Le beau line and the EDT is better than this, despite the EDT being terrible longevity and smelling too basic/linear"

But after further smelling I pick up a creamy, salty, slightly figgy, sweet, spring-summer scent. I’ve tried the normal Le beau and that’s grown on me but I found it too synthetic for my taste, this is a greener, fresher entry to the Le beau line and I’m all for it."

Honestly, it smells nice, slightly similar to Le beau Le parfum but more ""greeny"" and for the rest of the fragrance while it's still on the skin it's mostly coconut and figs. Personally, I'd get it one day if it was on sale."

Extremely sweet, masculine, long lasting. Sweet coconut with a nice touch of ginger and mint in the opening. Then it drys down to a super sweet coconut. Mass appealing, gets you compliments and is not as thick and heavy as le beau le parfum, more versatile and easier to wear."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"What the actual ****!! There aren't many fragrances that last 24 hours and when you find one, it's usually pungent woody nose burning feces. This though, it's tropical, sweet, and aquatic. I just received my bottle yesterday and when I got out the shower, I sprayed two sprays on each wrist. It was actually too much. This is too sweet to overspray. I wore it to bed and woke up still smelling sweet and coconutty. I sprayed ADG Absolu on top because I didn't want to go to work smelling tropical. About the time I was heading home, I smelled my wrists because I thought I caught a whiff of coconut... and I was right!! The ADG wore off and the Paradise Garden began to shine again. INSANEI do like the scent. It's well worth the money. It's more of a spring/summer daytime fragrance than anything. I don't think this is very versatile but who knows... i might still like it in a few months. Our summers down here are hot and last at least 6 months so I will surely get my money's worth out of this."

Too sweet and synthetic. Yes it should have tropical style cause it is a coconut perfume, but i didn’t like that is smelled like a fruit juice. I wish it had gone in a more green and relaxing massage oil-like direction with coconut. Performance and sillage is very strong"

But then as it dries down you get what they advertise to you but just a bit different. A medium amount of vanilla, small amount of coconut and a big dose of this green scent that i just cant describe.Perfomance is alright lasted around 6 hours on my skin, and about 2 inches away from my arm i could start to smell it.smell: 7/10perfomance: 6.5/10overall: 8/10(I dont really like the opening, i already hate burberry touch)"

Excellent longevity and great projection. As per my opinion,it is more of unisex because I am not getting ginger at all. Linear smell but really loud with great trail. Compliment booster. I recommend not to blind buy as sweet coconut remains persistent and I don't think everyone would love it. However, it is great blind buy for me fortunately."

Maybe you got a fake or something is wrong with it because why would any company release something that smells bad.It’s nice, best out of the le beau line for me because I like the green and salty aspect. It’s nothing too special but it’s a nice scent 8/10"

When I got back home I was getting headache due to this very strong, synthetic and messy smell. I couldn't wash it off - unfortunatelly for me it's very strong and longlasting.I wouldn't like to smell it on anybody. Theoretically I like all of the notes in this but together they are toxic - maybe this is due to mixing the fresh and warm tones. I am unable to describe the scent but to me it is a bit like some kind of cleaning product with a bad smell. I can't believe it's so hyped."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Creamy, sugary coconut and green fig in the open. A few seconds later you get some interesting herbaceous notes around the outside with the creamy opening at the center. It *quickly* changes about 3 more times in the next few minutes. Salty, then vanillic, then even a touch floral. When you smell it up close, it feels kind of like the elements are fighting for their place in the blend, but not in an unpleasant way. In the air, it's a much lighter, more interesting wear.I've caught moments of it being bracingly fresh, and others with a slightly watery honeydew melon-type vibe. The sandalwood is NOT overly woodsy. Rather, it joins the creamy opening pretty seamlessly. It's not the same scent, but to my nose, this sandalwood is used similarly to Tam Dao EDP from Diptyque. I *definitely* don't see the comparison to Santal 33 (one of my favorite scents). To me, this smells like a slightly fresher Tam Dao meets Debaser by DS & Durga. It even has a little bit of Edgewater from Michael Malul x Gents Scents in it, which would make sense consindering how much Ash likes this one. It's a cool scent that could earn a spot as a change of pace in a summer rotation."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is one of the best fragrances I've smelled on the last years. It is super versatile, you just adjust the sprays up or down and you're good. This smells good from up close, in the air, in the opening to the dry down, which is really uncommon. It is a massive compliment-getter as it is not too pretentious or complex, it has really good performance but not at the cost of being heavy on the nose like other fragrances do, it feels light when it hit your nose, but it still manages to be a pretty long lasting scent with good projection."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Le Beau Paradise Gardens By Jean Paul Gaultier was a massive surprise considering I had no expectations of this fragrance considering the other JPG fragrances from the Le Male or Le Beau line however I never got the chance to try this fragrance. Now I wouldn't say I like fragrances that are overhyped on social media but when I blind bought this I was extremely surprised. The smell is exactly what is on the tin, a classic summer fragrance that isn't amazing but it's not horrible with good notes of coconut, green, and oceanic notes taking over the scent making it a great fragrance for casual situations. Overall the scent is a basic but safe scent considering this is from JPG yet the price tag is a considerably different situation since this is sold out practically everywhere it feels like every store that somehow sells this will sell this at different prices, now I have this fragrance for around $150 for the 75ml version so idk if I have been scammed or not but I do believe this is slightly overpriced with better brands for less.Now the performance of this was the biggest shock of this fragrance. Other JPG scents have very poor longevity like Ultramale and Elixir which barely lasts but this scent lasts for around 8 hours which to me is crazy for a JPG and as an overall summer fragrance. The sillage is now what is disappointing as I can barely smell this from a conversational distance and I can only smell this at close distance.Scent: 8/10Performance: 5/10Longevity: 7/10Sillage: 2/10Price: 5/10Blind Buy Safe: 9/10Overall: 7/10"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Already one of my most complimented in my collection... It's a coconut scented sun lotion type of smell with a aquatic/salty twist making this the perfect fresh and sweet fragrance. The fig too provides a green, juicy and sweet backbone to the formula making it highly mass appealing from the top to bottom.Paradise garden is pretty strong, especially in the opening hours do not overspray!! (I got told it was way too strong once) After the bottle has been sitting for a couple months the longevity also goes well beyond 12+ hrs on my skin and on clothes it sticks for many days if not weeks... It's mainly a spring/summer fragrance but can be worn in fall too.To me this is the best one in the line with clear purpose of what is trying to do, Paradise garden is fresh and sweet done right.Highly Recommend 10/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Honest review:I bought samples of Jean Paul Gaultier Le Beau, Le Beau Le Parfum and Paradise Garden. Im having a hard time choosing. All 3 are amazing and share the same DNA. Keep in mind that if you DON’T like coconut, tonka or sweet fragrances this is NOT for you!!!!!Le Beau EDT (8/10) 🍋🥥 has a fresh citric opening and remains a sweet/creamy fragrance with coconut and tonka as its base notes. It’s super fresh and i would classify it as a summer everyday fragrance. This one doesn’t last as long as the other 2.Le beau Le Parfum (8.5/10)🍍🪻🥥has a rich strong opening (they removed the critic component) that has pineapple, iris & woody notes. I can’t smell the ginger but it’s cited as one of the opening notes. Le Parfum is the longer lasting among the 3. The smell transitions into a rich ambery’ one containing sandalwood. Could be overpowering in summer days. It’s better for spring, summer nights and fall.Lastly, Paradise Garden (9/10)💧🍃🥥 (instead of citrus or pineapple) has a green opening where you can smell the mint and fig. Its shares features of the 2 previous ones as it keeps the coconut/tonka dna and also uses sandalwood as its base note. It’s also very fresh and could be used for spring and summer.I will buy most likely buy a full bottle of JPG-Paradise Garden as i live in a very hot and tropical climate. Otherwise, i would go for Le Parfum. If you live in a more template climate go for Le Parfum, specially if you’re an adult and want a more mature and rich fragrance. If you’re in school go full fresh with Le Beau EDT or Paradise Garden.As a personal preference, I wouldn’t recommend buying all 3 bc they are similar. I would rather diversify your collection trying other fragrances.Remember that fragrance preferences are subjective and may perform differently on each person skin, give them a try… ;)Regards,Snow"

It is a PURE summer fragrance, and works really well in the higher heat. I sampled this yesterday whilst out with my wife and she was floored by it. So much so I had to buy a bottle (for both of us to wear). The projection isn't beastly but the longevity is. My wife was still goo goo this morning after still smelling this on my beard from the initial test spray (3 squirts) yesterday, which is very surprising after it being a freshy.I think I still have a good month of wearing this in the UK until Autumn gets a good grip on the climate. Enjoy it while you can."

To me, this is a slightly less sweet ultra male with some Le Male DNA and some coconut and mint thrown in. Definitely a nice smelling fragrance. Do not buy it for the ridiculous prices of $160+ though or you’ll be severely disappointed. It’s definitely very “designer” and smells synthetic. It reminds me a little of a fragrance I used to wear, eau de grey flannel, with its synthetic mint note smelling kind of like eucalyptus— but this scent is much sweeter and more coconut forward. Overall, I like this fragrance and think it would definitely pull a lot of compliments."

I understand the green notes can be overwhelming to some but after the dry down a sweet, refreshing coconut scent reminiscent of my local restaurants coconut cake takes over. The coconut is strong but not overwhelmingly sweet, so the scent itself still remains crisp and watery. Highly recommend for the summer, but I feel like it could serve me well in the winter if used during the day."

Takes Le Beau EDT, and adds ginger and mint, while expanding on it's longevity, of which is lasting me about 6-8 hours on clothes and skin. Beautifully crafted, a shame it took so long to become more available in the states. Glad I could get a 4.2oz during that last restock."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This might be my favorite fragrance in my entire collection. It's like the original Le Beau but so much more complex, to the point that the original is not worth buying. Top notes of coconut, mint, ginger. I can definitely smell the fig and green notes as well, and it does have the base tonka of the original DNA. This works great in high heat too, and I can wear it in the middle of summer with no problem. Such a great fragrance, definitely worth trying if you like JPG and sweet fresh fragrances."

The sweetness and freshness combined together create a harmony for my nose that I just cannot stop adoring. As it dries even more, you pick up more of that sandalwood that's in there, and the tonka bean vanilla flavour starts to also kick in later on. On my skin, it lasts 8+ hours, which for a summer/spring-type fragrance is fantastic. I have fallen in love with this fragrance from the first instance I smelled it.Overall, I would rate this fragrance a solid 9/10."

Paradise Garden.. honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid my nose on you. Jokes aside, I absolutely love this fragrance. From the first time i smelled it on my friend, I KNEW I had to buy it. Everytime he was wearing it, i would smell the fragrance before we would even dap each other up. The smell is just gorgeous, one that stands out, and the projection helps at that too. Now i must say, the longevity is THE ONLY part where it is mid, i get around 6-7 hours, but considering it is a fresh fragrance, i'm not even surprised. And i don't even care that much, the gorgeous green minty notes combined with coconut, fig and tonka make it one of the best scents i've personally smelled, and again, projection is also insane. I really don't get why people hate on it so much, I guess it's become a trend for people to hate on something just because it's popular and hyped up."

It’s A good scent don’t get me wrong but it’s very close to le beau le parfum which I already own. Lasted around 7 hours. It’s redundant to have both so will be trading or selling off
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Alright, so I finally got my grubby paws on this one after quite a bit of searching. I have to admit, the hype kind of set the bar a bit high. I'm not fully disappointed since I did not own the Le Beau EDT and I do feel Paradise Garden is an improvement over the EDT. The fig note here freshens up the EDT and avoids the ""suncream"" effet I really hate from most coconut fragrances. It really surprises me since fig is usually a note I'm challenged with. Quentin's work at its prime, it seems.I can understand some who would be underwhelmed, though. If you own the Le Beau EDT this is absolutely unnecessary besides the cool tin. I daresay however that I think I prefer Paradise Garden over the Le Beau Le Parfum. I find the pineapple note screechy and sweaty on my skin. All in all, I don't think I wasted my money on Paradise Garden but the hype did set the bar a little (too) high. This is still going to be a great summer fragrance for the rest of the year and for summer 2025. The longevity is decent and about the same as my Le Beau EDT sample, so about half of Le Parfum. I still think the best summer JPG is Le Male In the Navy so far. If you prefer aquatics, go for that. If you prefer greener vibes and coconut, go for Le Beau Paradise Garden or Le Parfum. Or CK Eternity Aromatic Essence, that was a huge surprise earlier this year (similar DNA but woodier, dryer and less sweet than both Le Beau EDT and Paradise Garden)."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I know JPG fragrances get a lot of hype, but this one did not live up to it! My reasons for this were the pickled cucumber note I was getting and the weak projection. I do however think that the Le Beau Le Parfum Intense is a great fragrance, where I don't have any of those issues. To each their own. Quentin's Kenzo Homme Marine has a similar scent profile to this and I prefer that one way more."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Not worth the hype. The Le Beau EDT and Le Parfum are much better performance wise, both on longevity and projection.This one,.. I've worn it a bunch of times, and i did get a hint of pickle from that fig note sometimes in the open.Aside from the opening it's not terribly different from the OG Le Beau and Le Parfum except this is a slight bit less sweet. Oh, and it lacks in comparison to the performance.If you don't have the others, this isn't a bad buy. If you want to dial back the sweetness a bit. If you do have the others, then this one is kind of redundant to own, unless you want the weaker little brother.6.5/10 Performance is mid, scent is redundant. And the opening is a crap shoot."

This is better for transition seasons 🫤This is loud in the beginning, becoming skin scent in 2-3hrs. This is also for younger crowds and casual."

This perfume is what the man would smell like. It opens boldly with a strong coconut note, but oddly I wouldn't call it gourmet. That note is balanced by the watery notes and ginger, which aren't recognizable, at least not on my skin, but have a note-worthy contribution. It dries into a more fig forward scent, but you can still feel the nuttiness of the coconut, and the tonic and sandalwood are much more apparent. If you want to smell manly and flamboyant and desirable, this is the scent you want."

This is not just any garden; it is the epitome of paradise, where nature’s splendor and romance converge. The air is heavy with the intoxicating scent of blooming flowers and the distant sound of waves crashing against a pristine shore. A single spritz of Jean Paul Gaultier’s Paradise Garden transports you deep into this fantasy.The opening notes of coconut immediately whisk you away to a secluded beach, where the sun-kissed coconuts fall gently from swaying palms. This sweet, creamy aroma mingles with the earthy richness of fig, evoking a sense of abundance and fertility. It's as if the garden is alive, pulsing with the promise of hidden delights.Strolling through this aromatic haven, you catch the subtle hint of salt carried by a gentle sea breeze. The saltiness is not overpowering but rather a delicate whisper, reminding you of ocean spray and the endless horizon beyond. This touch of salt adds an unexpected twist to the sweetness, much like a pinch of salt in a decadent dessert enhances its flavors.As you continue your exploration, the deeper, more sensual notes of tonka bean begin to emerge. This rich, warm scent envelops you like a lover’s embrace, igniting a spark of passion and desire. It is as if the very essence of the garden is calling you to surrender to its seductive charms.And then there’s the sandalwood, grounding and woody, providing a solid foundation for this aromatic adventure. Its smooth, creamy texture lingers on your skin, creating a sense of calm and stability amidst the lush opulence.But wait, there’s more! Just as you think you’ve experienced all the garden has to offer, a burst of minty freshness surprises you. This invigorating note is like a cool breeze on a hot day, refreshing and revitalizing your senses. It’s the perfect finishing touch to this fragrant symphony, leaving you feeling both energized and at peace.In this paradise garden, with the scent of Jean Paul Gaultier’s creation enveloping you, making sweet love to your partner feels like the most natural thing in the world. The cologne’s harmonious blend of coconut, fig, salt, tonka bean, sandalwood, and mint creates an unforgettable experience, one that is both playful and deeply romantic. This is not just a cologne; it is a scented journey to bliss, a paradise that you can return to again and again with every spritz."

But if you can't get past that green note it smells disgusting. I've been going back and forth thinking about if I like it cause that green note is what makes people hate it so much. Even me myself who loves all le beaus think that the green note is weird sometimes. If you don't like the green note, 4/10, if you love it or don't mind it, 9/10.Theres also a mint note that I don't enjoy that much. Personally I give it an 8.75/10, it's pretty good but too controversial. A bunch of my cologne buddys say its the best of the le beaus or the worst of the le beaus.If you are reading this, just get le beau le parfum. I think it's much better and some people even have it at the top of their JPG list of all time. It's an actual 10/10.Overall it still is really nice and fresh, perfect for spring-summer-fall. When I first got it I hyped it up so much, but it's not that breathtaking. I still love it though, a must have for coconut and JPG lovers."

Death-by-coconut, those who love sweet coconut in perfumery will find it appealing. I would go as far as classify it a semi-gourmand because of how dominant this note is. I say ""semi-gourmand"" because i find the note so exagerated and intense its not even realistic. There is an influence of tonka bean, to create a fluffy soft base.It gives off tropical vibes. Actually, a better name would have been Tropical Garden because somehow i imagine ""Paradise"" to smell greener and more ""garden-y"". Ironically, i feel like it would be too cloying for me in the summer heat, in the same way Kenzo Homme EDP is. It shares a similarity with the Kenzo, not through scent, but through the chemical compounds used. Both are created by Quentin Bisch and honestly im not a fan of his work. What i will give to him is he knows how to make beast mode synthetic fragrances. JPG Paradise Garden lasts alot on my skin, the next day i could still faintly smell the aroma on my hand after a shower. I believe it draws compliments aswell because it has the diffusiveness and longevity to do so.It could pass as unisex, especially in the first couple of hours. Definetly for a young crowd.In comparition, Le Beau Le Parfum is less focused on the coconut, more ""fragrancy"", more versatile and palatable to me hence why i prefer it to Paradise Garden."

Eases up on the sweetness and adds this fresh green note that blends soo well with the coconut. I guess it’s not gonna be for everyone, but personally I don’t understand how someone wouldn’t like this scent! The dry down reminds me of CH MAN Sport (if you know, you know lol) except it smells even better and performs better! Definitely sample it before you buy the full bottle.Overall rating: 8.5/10Great scent, performance, and silliage"

I get around 7 hours longevity. It isn't as loud as le beau EDP when it projects but it smells nice and fresh 9/10
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The opening is a fresh and more pleasant than the original in my opinion. It still has that coconut fresh aroma but with a greener, brighter, more exotic scent. Right from the go I can pick up the welcome introduction of mint and ginger for a less bitter, more refreshing experience. The smell is fairly similar to the original in the dry down too, but smells fresher, like a clean, airy coconut but with an extra sweetness from the fig and is actually closer to what I was expecting from the Le Beau EDT. In fact I was happy that I could actually smell this one! It definitely smells modern with a classic tropical summer vibe that it's hard to go wrong with. While I think most men would be able to pull this off in the summer heat, it's definitely best suited for a younger man, similar to the original.I was impressed with this, especially after the original left me bitterly dissapointed. I could still smell this for about 7 or 8 hours after I first sprayed it and even after 10 hours I still get pieces of it. Not only that but I can actually smell it! I don't know if it's the formulation or what but PG smelled so much fresher, lasted ages on my skin and clothes and I kept getting waves of it. Its not as strong as the parfum version but definitely performs better than the OG and you don't need as many spraysThis fragrance is daytime through and through, probably the most of the Le Beau line. The coconut is key to these fragrances and that gives it an awesome vibe for summer that fits right in, but I think the green freshness makes it appropriate for spring too. Killer daytime event fragrance and even does well for work.The prices I've seen are pretty crazy due to lack of availability at £100 for 125ml which is £80 per 100ml. It's pretty damn pricey but it smells super good, performs pretty well and makes a solid, refreshing summer frag. However I don't think I'll be splashing the cash on this one anytime soon, I'd go with Le Beau Le Parfum instead."

And to top it all off, you won’t smell this elsewhere it’s really unique and it’s beautiful.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Imma update later but in the opening all i smell is a salty fruity wet grass. Ngl kinda smells like a weird drink. Im looking for something that smells like dew on a grassy lawn for a signature scent and this is just too fruity to be that. maybe the drydown is better idk but im really annoyed because this had so much potential to be my signature scent.OK update; I could get behind this. It smells like an aquatic green smell still but it lost all saltyness and much fruityness. There is still alot of vanilla and coconut though which reminds me alot of le beau edt. I think the opening smells like an adidas fragrance and the dry down is pretty solid so do with that knowledge what you wish. Im not gonna pick it up though. Maybe I wear my sample again but I aint paying for a full bottle.

So if you just removed the citrus in Le Beau EDT and had just the dry down then you’d have this. Extremely similar and redundant to own both. Not a bad fragrance at all but since I own the EDT and like that bright opening it has before settling into the coconut smell, this is a pass for me"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I sampled this and le beau edt at the same time before buying a 125ml bottle secondhand for about 5 USD over retail. The availability is ridiculously limited in North America right now. To me, it feels like the edt was very simple and paradise garden fully fleshed out the idea of it. The opening is extremely vibrant and attention grabbing. As others say, if you don’t like fig or coconut, this probably isn’t for you. I’d say it’s mainly aromatic in the opening and mid. The aquatic notes and base notes are in the background. In the dry down the coconut accents the sandalwood and aromatics to carry the fragrance to its end. I tried all of the currently available le male and le beau flankers before buying this as I’d never smelt them before (besides the original le male just passing by people). It’s interesting smelling the progression from the OG le male to now this and le male lover as the latest flankers. They’ve kept the same simplicity and core proprietary notes of vanilla, and mint (usually lavender too) but still manage to come up with new worthy successors. Hopefully this hits discounters consistently one of these days."

When I tried it on paper it was a nice blend between coconut and sweet, I also thought it was very fresh on first impresion. But after Buying it and trying it out on skin its a different story, when you first spray it you are greeated with a overwhelming coconut scent. But after five minutes the coconut is compleatly gone and all that is left is a green scent with hint of fig and sweetness. I would have liked it more if the coconut was evenly spread out instead of being in your face the first five minutes and then disapearing.Longevety 8/ 10Sillage 7/ 10Scent 6.5/ 10Do not recomend for anyone Who does not like green scents"

This fragrance opens up with an uplifting minty, kind of a candied green appley and fig type of sweetness with salt nicely complimenting with the sweetness of the fragrance. After the dry down, the minty, green appley fig sweetness with the salt stills stays with a perfect amount of coconut and greenery (the green note smells like the atmosphere of a waterfall in the forest) to set off the tropical vibes. This isn't an everyday fragrance or (you shouldn't be wearing this casually), this is a fragrance reserved for a holiday in a tropical island, country (bali, etc.).

Since then I have tried around 100 fragrances. This sweet summer scent is perfect for young guys. I think this fragrance has no problem with pojection at all until the late middle notes where in my opinion the smell shines. Gents Scents said the opening was the best and I understand why he said this, because the scent is projecting it’s best at the beginning. I do not agree with him I personally think it’s to fruity and sour. but my gosh this fragrance has such a good mid. It’s sweet fresh and warm and I’m not glazing it’s really really good. I also think this scent is decently versatile in any warm weather. I have received a couple compliments and heard people whisper that smells good. I think for the jpg line this one comes in 3rd it’s a heated take. And YES I HAVE TRIED ALL THE OTHERS. Obviously le male le parfum #1 and ultramale #2 Elixir, le beau edt, and the other le beau all give me a headache."

It’s a nice departure from the EDT and EDP. But, after about an hour when that opening has faded and you’re in the mid to drydown, it’s just the EDT. I think it’s better than the EDT due to its opening, but you don’t need both.I’m actually kind of disappointed in this one considering all the hype it’s getting. I’ll give it some more wear and update again, but just like with the EDT and EDP, I’m not feeling it."

The fresh salty and minty green opening fairly quickly yields to the sweet creaminess of coconut paired with fig which I very much enjoy. The dry down is very nice as well with the tonka bean taking the lead. Sandalwood and ginger are not overly apparent to my nose.This is one of those fragrances that fooled me into thinking it’s a weak performer because after an hour or so it’s difficult for me to smell it. That said, I was asked in the grocery store today what I was wearing by two different ladies both of whom said they loved it and wanted to buy it for their BFs. I was pleasantly surprised that anyone else could smell it since after 5 hours of running errands I thought it had long vanished.If you love the other Le Beau fragrances I think you’ll love Paradise Garden too."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Ok, do we need More from JPG with the twist of mint and tonka bean? Difficult to answer! Personally, I've grown out of La male and its flankers. I think it is a kind of how to say, it's kind of been there, done that, if you get me:-). So I try to be really neutral in my review of it. It is somehow unique since it has a dash of fig in it. And that is something I like. And salt. I did not know how pleasant salt can smell until some years ago I was in a place in Iran and I got to experience the wonderful odor of salt, and it was Blue salt, which is unique. You can find that salt only i one place in the whole world, and that is Iran. Back to perfume. I did not like the opening. It was terrible on both my and my friend's skin. But it passed after 15 minutes. We smelled almond to begin with, but it disappeared after 45 minutes. The odor of fig and salt started to show after 20 minutes. But we could also smell mint, water and some other notes that I could not find a similar, but my friend meant it was green notes! What green notes he could not say! The rest is like La Male original, tonka and sandal dominates.Longevity: I got 3ish hours out of it. It was not very hot outside, so in a cooler environment maybe 4-4.5 hoursSilage: Not very strong ! 1 meter or so, not more. And remember it is in the first 1 and 1.5 hour. After that, people should really get close to you so they can smell it. One solution can be to spray it on cloth, which I do not like. Other solution is over-spraying it, which I do not recommend.Gender: I would say masculine which can be used by ladies too.It is overpriced. This should not be more than 60-65 USD for 125 ml.Compliment Magnet: It is a good compliment receiver, both gentlemen and ladies, and also from young adults, between 18-25, complimented the perfume. It was a kind of surprise:-).Age: 28 years aboveVerdict: If you have La Male Ultra, Elixir or La Male Le Parfum so it would not be necessary to buy this one. If you want something new from JPG so go for it. I was not disappointed, but was not overwhelmed by it either. I would give it a very strong 4.5. Test it at least a couple of times before purchasing. But again I received compliments from many in different gender and age.Norsk: NorwegianOk, trenger vi mer fra JPG med en vri av mynte og tonkabønne? Vanskelig å svare på det! Personlig har jeg vokst ut av La Male og dens flankere. Jeg tror det er en slags gjentagelse av det samme med litt pynt her og der. Så jeg prøver å være veldig nøytral i min anmeldelse av denne. Den er på en eller annen måte unik siden den har en dædråpe av fiken og litt salt i seg. Jeg liker fiken og salt. Jeg visste ikke hvor behagelig salt kankunne lukte før jeg var på et sted i Iran for noen år siden og fikk oppleve den fantastiske lukten av salt, og det var blått salt, som er unikt. Du kan finne saltet bare på ett sted i hele verden, og det er Iran. Tilbake til parfyme. Jeg likte ikke åpningen. Det var forferdelig på min og min venns hud. Men gikk det over etter 15 minutter. Vi luktet mandel ,nærmer bitter mandel, til å begynne med, men den forsvant etter 45 minutter. Lukten av fiken og salt begynte å vise seg etter 20 minutter. Men vi kunne også lukte mynte, vann og noen andre toner som jeg ikke kunne beskrive, men vennen min mente det var grønne/plante/gress toner! Hvilke grønne kunne han heller ikke si! Resten er som La Male original med tonka og sandal som dominerer.Varighet: Jeg fikk presset ut rundt 3 timer ut av det. Det var ikke varmt vær ute, så i et kjøligere vær kanskje 4-4,5Silage/etter dufting: Ikke veldig sterk! 1 meter eller så, ikke mer. Og husk at det er i begynnelsen. den første 1 og 1,5 timen. Etter det bør folk virkelig komme nært deg slikså at de kan lukte det. En løsning kan være å spraye det på tøy, noe jeg ikke det liker. En annen løsning er å oversprøyte det, noe jeg ikke anbefaler.Kjønn: Jeg vil si maskulin som kan brukes av damer også.Folks Mening: Til min stor overraskelse fikk jeg mange komplimenter fra både damer og herre i forskjellige aldresgrupper. Dette setter jeg pris for når jeg kjøper en duft.Aldre: 28 år og oppover.Det er overpriset. Dette bør ikke være mer enn 800 NKR for 125 ml. Utslagsprisen er over 1500 Nkr for 125ml hvilket ikke er verdt.Bedømmelse: Hvis du har La Male Ultra, Elixir eller La Male Le Parfum så er det ikke nødvendig å kjøpe denne. Hvis du vil ha noe nytt fra JPG, så gå for det. Jeg ble ikke skuffet i allefall, men ble heller ikke overveldet av det. Alle rundt me likte duften, det var ingen som reagerte negativ. Dette er en stor pluss og en av de viktigste grunner for å kjøpe dufter. Test den minst et par ganger før du kjøper. Ikke test den på en papir strip men heller på huden. Ikke la selger spray den på et strip og hir den til deg for å dufte på den. Aldri kjøp uten å ha testet på huden din to ganger minst.فارسی Persian:خوب ببینیم ، آیا ما به یک ادکلن جدید از JPG با بوی نعناع و دانه تونکا نیاز داریم؟ جوابش سخته! من شخصاً از La male ومشتقات آن بزرگ خسته شده ام . به نظر من این مثل فیلمهای تکراری آمریکایی ست که در مورد سوپرمن و بتمن ووواست. اما سعی می‌کنم که در بررسی آن بی‌طرف باشم. این به نوعی منحصر به فرد و نو است برای JPG ان هم به دلیل بوی انجیر و نمککه در آن بو میکنید و من از بوی نمک و انجیرخوشم میاد. من برای اولین بار بوی نمک را در ایران عزیز خودمون تجربه کردم. آن هم نمک آبی بود که فقط منحصر به ایران است و در ایران عزیز خودمون پیدا میشه. چند دقیقه اول یک بوی نامطلوبی دشت که میتواند تو ذوق بزند. من و یکی از دوستانم ب هم این را تست کردیم و هر دوی ما از این بو خیلی خوسمون نیامد ولی بازی اوقات این فقط همان دقایق اول است که میتواند بوی دلپذیری نباشد . اما بعد از۱۵ دقیقه دیگر قابل حس نبود. در همان دقایق اول بوی بادام را حس میکنید, انهم نه بادام معمولی بلکه بادام تلخ. این بوی بادام تلخ در ۴۵ دقیقه اول خیلی مشخص و غالب و بعد از ۴۵ دقیقه ناپدید شد. بوی انجیر و نمک بعد از ۲۰ دقیقه خودشان را نشان میدهند.بعد از حدودا ۱ ساعت بوی نعناع، آب و چند رایحه دیگر را هم حس می‌کردیم که من مشابه آنها را نمیتوانم توصیف کنم ، اما دوستم متقد بود که اینها رایحه های سبز هستند! چه رایحه های سبزیکه او هم توانایی توصیف آنها را نداشت ! بعد از تقریبا ۲ ساعت مثل La Male اصل است، تونکا و صندل غالب هستند .طول عمر: برای من ۳ ساعت به سختی دوام دشت . هوا خیلی گرم نبود، بنابراین در هوای سردتر ممکن است ۴ تا ۴/۵ ساعت دوام داشته باشد.توانایی پخش در محیط : خیلی قوی نیست! ۱ متر یا بیشتر، نه بیشتر. و به یاد داشته باشید که در ۱-۱/۵ ساعت اول است. پس از آن مردم باید واقعاً به شما نزدیک شوند تا بوی آن را حس کنند. یک راه حل می تواند این باشد که آن را روی لباس اسپری کنید که من دوست ندارم چون ممکن است خیلی قوی بشود . راه حل دیگر اسپری بیش از حد آن است که من ان را هم توصیه نمی کنم چون در هرصورت ان تاثیری بر توانایی زنده ماندن رایحه ندارد ان فقط رایحه عطر را قویتر میکنند.مردانه یا زنانه : به نظر من این بیشتر مردانه است تا زنانه انهم به دلیل عطر بادام تلخ که می تواند خیلی مردانه باشد ولی چون بعد از نیم ساعت این رایحه میرود خانم ها هم میتوانند از آن استفاده کنند.من در مورد قیمت چیزی نمیتوانم بگویم چون در ایران زندگی نمیکنم ولی در کل زیاده از هد قیمت گزاشتند.تحسین برانگیز: تقریبا هر کسی که این را بو کرده خیلی از آن تعریف کرده و خوششان آمدههم بانوان وآقایان, و هم افراد مسن و خیلی جوان.گروه سنی: ۲۸ سال به بالا.حکم:اگر الاکسیر, اولترا یا عطر ژان پل را دارید، پس نیازی به خرید این یکی نیست. اگر چیز جدیدی می خواهید، و دوست دارین که یک کم ,نه خیلی زیاد,در یک جمع منحصر بفرد باشین, این را توصیه میکنم. اینکه خیلیها از این عطر خوششان آمد در هر صورت خیلی مهم است. ولی حتما قبل از خرید حداقل دو بار آن را تست کنید. چون عطر هم به شخصیت شما و هم به بوی بدن شما وابسته استEspañol, SpanishOk, ¿necesitamos más de JPG con el giro de la menta y la frijol tonka? ¡Difícil de responder! Personalmente, he surgido de Los Ángeles y sus flancos. Creo que es una especie de cómo decir, ha estado allí, hecho eso, si me consigues :-). Así que trato de ser realmente neutral en mi revisión. De alguna manera es único, ya que tiene una pizca de higos. Y eso es algo que me gusta. Y sal. No sabía cuán agradable puede oler la sal hasta que hace algunos años estaba en un lugar en Irán y pude experimentar el maravilloso olor de sal, y era sal azul, lo cual es único. Puedes encontrar esa sal solo en un lugar en todo el mundo, y ese es Irán. Volver al perfume. No me gustó la apertura. Fue terrible tanto en la piel de mi y mi amigo. Pero pasó después de 15 minutos. Para empezar, olimos a almendras, pero desapareció después de 45 minutos. El olor de la higos y la sal comenzó a mostrarse después de 20 minutos. Pero también podríamos oler a Mint, Water y algunas otras notas que no pude encontrar un similar, ¡pero mi amigo quiso decir que eran notas verdes! ¡Qué notas verdes no pudo decir! El resto es como el original de LA Original, Tonka y Sandal Dominan.Longevidad: obtuve 3 horas fuera de él. No hacía mucho calor afuera, así que en un entorno más fresco tal vez 4-4.5 horasSilaje: ¡No muy fuerte! 1 metro más o menos, no más. Y recuerde que es en las primeras 1 y 1.5 horas. Después de eso, la gente realmente debería acercarse a ti para que puedan olerlo. Una solución puede ser rociarlo sobre tela, lo que no me gusta. Otra solución es exagerarlo, lo que no recomiendo.Género: Yo diría que masculino, que también puede ser utilizado por las damas.Es demasiado caro. Esto no debe ser más de 60-65 USD por 125 ml.Magnet de cumplido: es un buen receptor de cumplido, tanto caballeros como damas, y también de adultos jóvenes, entre 18-25, complementó el perfume. Fue una especie de sorpresa :-).Edad: 28 años anteriorVeredicto: Si tienes la ultra, elixir o la macho de la macho de la macho, para que no fuera necesario comprar este. Si quieres algo nuevo de JPG, así que hazlo. No me decepcionó, pero tampoco estaba abrumado por eso. Le daría un 4.5 muy fuerte. Pruébelo al menos un par de veces antes de comprar. Pero nuevamente recibí cumplidos de muchos en diferentes géneros y edad."

The coconut gives it a creamy sweetness which blends well with the green fresh notes. Performance is very good although it may not seem like it as it is prone to noseblindness (I sprayed this on and couldnt really pick it up that much but then was told that you could smell it as soon as I walked in the room an hour later).

Overall, it's a pretty different departure from the original Le Beau and Le Beau le Parfum. Those two have a rounder profile and more mass appealing because of the sweetness of Tonka bean.The addition of the Fig in Paradise Garden makes it very hard to be a mass appealing fragrance. Some folks will enjoy it while others will absolutely hate the fig. I myself cannot stand the fig in here and thinks it ruins what makes Le Beau great. JPG generally creates pretty versatile and mass appealing scents, but this one is definitely not a blind buy fragrance. Very polarizing for some, definitely try before you buy.Performance and projection is on par with Le Parfum, I get very strong projection and great longevity. In my personal opinion, scent 6/10 and Performance 10/10."

Buy azzaro chrome pure for 30 bucks. It came first so it's the OG. Plus it's a quarter the price on discounters.

The hype ruined my experience, and expectations, I expected this to be a bit more, but to me, it’s an ok fragrance. It is too casual, and youthful for my taste alone. But I think younger gents, such as those in tiktok, love the appeal of this fragrance, and it’s reasonable.Personally, I would suggest Le Beau Le Parfum to a teenager that wants the most out of the Le Beau DNA. But for me, it is trendy, not much going on here, it is just an ok for me but then again, it’s my opinion, and my personal taste. But, overall it has ok performance, ok scent, 7/10. I am glad I didn’t bought a full bottle, and just a sample of it. I can tell this is a great fragrance for a teenager but not for me, I personally lean to more sophisticated, timeless, and mature scents, and this fragrance is the opposite of that."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Why has this fragrance been so popular since its premiere? I don't know. Although the Le Beau series is not a world championship, I like the other two fragrances and compared to them, Paradise Garden is quite pale and inferior.The green notes that are in the opening come out very vegetal on my skin. I smell fresh cucumber and dill. For me, there is too much of this cucumber note and it doesn't smell good at all, although the situation is somewhat saved by the mint that stubbornly tries to break through these cucumbers.The greenery lasts about 15 minutes and then Paradise Garden moves on to a motif well known from the classic Le Beau, the sweet Bounty bar. A slight variation is the addition of some aquatic notes, thanks to which this coconut is not so sweet, it is more like sweetened coconut water, but is it worth the candle? In my opinion, no, because after 30 minutes it smells like basic Le Beau, only more watered down.Adding a fig to the set sometimes brings Paradise Garden closer to Kenzo Homme Intense. Quentin Bisch is slowly starting to eat his tail because he repeats the same motifs in subsequent perfumes that are not much different from each other.I was not convinced by Paradise Garden and I think that this premiere does not add anything important to the Le Beau series. In addition, the price is ridiculously high, especially considering that it smells quite synthetic.Longevity is not bad, about 7-8 hours, moderate projection.6/10"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is definitely gonna be my most worn fragrance for this summer! Opens with a fresh mint along with that sweet fig note. Dries down to a slightly creamy but still fresh woody + coconut scent. The projection is absolutely nuclear for a summer fragrance, especially in the opening. I wore this on a warm slightly windy day and i kept getting these fresh-sweet whiffs of salty coconut and fig. Kind of reminds me of a sun lotion, but of course much higher quality. I have gotten a couple of compliments on it so far and actually a boy around my age that was a complete stranger came up to me and asked what I was wearing. I told him it was this and he looked surprised and said he had given it a smell in store, but didn't like it. He was really surprised of how good it was on me and I told him he should go get a sample and try it out for a couple days.The scent itself is quite synthetic, but not in a bad way like YSL Y EDP. Le Beau Paradise Garden actually has some structure and doesn't feel like a complete mess.This definitely leans youthful and is a day time scent. But I could also see it being great for summer evenings and night outs.Amazing scent 9/10!"

Le Beau EDT smells too linear and has horrible performance, hard for me to want to wear for a long day. Le Beau Le Parfum is WAY too strong, and the middle notes smell genuinely bad, extremely synthetic coconut/wood, very hard to wear.Paradise Garden is the perfect in between, sweet, so fresh. Easy to wear and lasts incredibly long. Say whatever about the opening notes, but the middle coconut is gorgeous. By far JPGs best coconut scent."

It is quite expensive, but your paying for quality. It is really good for summer/spring and has nice projection (not to quiet, not to loud). Definitely a green/fresh fragrance, but on the dry down it smells more like sweet coconut. Would recommend for a younger audience (not saying you can't buy it if you're older) as it is more of a 'youthful' scent.9.2/10. Would be 10/10 if it wasn't as expensive."

The salt and fig and fig are clearly there but less strong as the green notes and coconut, however the coconut is not as nuclear as it is in Le Beau Le Parfum.I’d personally rate it a 9/10 I would wear it but the performance is ever so slightly lacking, that said it does smell nice and will pull compliments."

Longevity is monstrous, sillage is good for maybe 2 to 3 hours on my skin, then it sits close to the skin but you can smell some breezes occasionally. Overall, I'd give it a 9/10 since it lasted more than 12 hours, maybe goes for 24h mark if you don't shower but that's happening only on my skin. Have to mention that not a lot of fragrances last good on me, but I got 2 JPGs in my collection(Le Male Le Parfum and Paradise Garden) and they really perform on my skin, no doubt. Have a great time everybody!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Beau-Paradise-Garden-88836.html,Le Beau Paradise Garden Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Received mine yesterday 22/12/2023. Photo posted on fragram. I'm from Brazil and I bought it from Mercado Livre.In the early days of my journey, I already used Le Male and Fleur du Male by JPG, since then I never bought anything else from the brand.My fiancée still uses Classique Edp and Edt today and she already used Classique Essence de Parfum which was one of our favorites. Her favorites on me are Dior Homme Intense and Le male, despite the many options I have, for the moments and memories. But whenever we went to a Sephora, she really liked the Le Beau line, which is a rarity.Le Beau Paradise Garden was released in pair with the old La Belle Fleur Terrible, which is now called La Belle Paradise Garden. I bought it blindly just by the notes and the fact that she liked the others, now... we really love this one.It opens with that vibe of Divine by JPG and Eden-Roc by Dior, that salty maritime smell that reminds some of eggs. The smell of coconut is relevant from the beginning, the same note as the others in this line, but that maritime vibe is not as strong as in the others mentioned. In the middle, after 30 minutes, the semi-fresh, green, maritime and salty opening fades into the background and the coconut becomes increasingly milky and sweet. Unlike the others in this line, this one has fig in the notes, but it's not something as noticeable as in Dioriviera where the fig is strong and apparent, but it's something that can be noticed by the coconut with green and fresh notes, as coconut and fig are always close together in perfumery. In the drydown, it becomes a sweet woody powdery scent with the coconut more apparent, less sweet than the others in the line, but similar. Still, the coconut seems like a milky dessert in the end, coconut pudding, coconut candy, coconut bread.Longevity of 12+ hours, enough to never fade until you take a shower. For Brazil, it is very tasty, very tropical, fun and casual. The best in the brand currently, top 5 best non-exclusives that you can buy for man from any brand now.The only problem is that something with this summer and beach theme is so strong and with a sweet middle and end, the fresh part doesn't last long, but it's great for summer night outings or a romantic date for the movies or dinner, just apply less quantity. Even during the day at a beach party... or something that starts in the afternoon and ends at night in a mild climate might be the ideal.I would give it 9 out of 10, but since it's my fiancée's favorite, I'm going to give it 10 out of 10 and enjoy it a lot this holiday season. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone, happy holidays"

It projects like crazy, much more than both Le Beau edt and Parfum. It lasts 12 hours om my skin, awsome sillage also.It reminds me a lot of Light Blue Eau Intense, but sweeter, more powdery version. It smells really salty, acquatic like light blue intense, some people will say it reminds them od eggs, but added mint instead of grapefruit and sweet, milky, powdery coconut which gives sweetnes to fresh minty salty scent. It has coconut and thats the only thing that is similar to previous flankers.Sweeter light blue intense, with more depth. 10/10 for me."

It's like jlog23 said, take the original Le Beau and put in the synthetic-smelling aquatic fig from Kenzo, and voilá. It's ultimately a letdown. Smells like coconut water with some figs. The worst of the three for me.I could write about the Garden of Eden (paradise garden), and how Adam and Eve are munching spitefully on juicy figs while the snake laughs chilling on a tree, but frankly, God has had the final laugh since He made figs from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil taste like water, or more likely, like tears of realisation that, once again, we've been duped by the hype machinery (beware of snakes, people)."

If you actually spray it on your clothes, it'll stay there for several days if not weeks. I bought this as an office friendly summer perfume and I received a ton of compliments for it. In the opening it's definitely similar to Terre d'Hermès, but then it settles into something like a citrusy hybrid of Warm Cotton from the brand ""Clean"". Definitely not super niché, but the smell is insanely nice, uplifting and refreshing. The best way I can describe it is ""Newly washed clothes with a warm touch"". Perfect as an every day perfume that'll please everyone who's close to you. Pro tip: spray 50% on your clothes and you'll both feel and smell fresh the entire day, even during super hot summer days."

Nothing new. Percival and galloway come to mind. This is very uplifting and almost heavy enough to be called a dark citrus. Very nice, smooth dry down too. PdM are just master's at making things smell good. I don't think there's a single bad smelling PdM, so far my least favorite is carlisle, and honestly that smells very nice too."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I LOVE Parfums de Marly Perseus!!! I'm sure I've already written a review on here, but I wanted to add my idea that people could start reporting how much their full and empty bottles weigh on here, because I bought a 75 ml bottle a couple months ago, after I fell in love with it, and had a $50 off coupon from ordering their sample pack. I love Haltane too, but I wasn't motivated to actually order a bottle of PDM until I tried Perseus!!!I absolutely love that bright, tart, uplifting grapefruit top scent note, and the ambergris dry down is just perfect. I didn't even know how ambergris smelled before I tried Perseus, and I'm sure that it's not real ambergris, but just ambroxide or ambroxan; I forget which one is a brand name, but it smells amazing to my nose.I just got into this hobby about six months ago, but I've already bought some really nice fragrances. Perseus is probably my favorite summer fragrance overall. I got a compliment from the cashier at the gas station a couple weeks ago or so. I just ran in to grab a couple gallons of milk, and I used a couple sprays of Perseus before I left the house.The lady cashier said that she really liked my fragrance, and that she had worked at the Dillard's fragrance department in the past, and she made a joke that she should recognize the scent. I told her that it was Parfums de Marly Perseus, and she asked where I got it. I told her that I ordered it from their website, but Nordstrom sells it too, and she said that she hasn't been to Nordstrom in a long time, and she wants to go again. It was really nice.Anyway, if people could start weighing their full and empty Perseus bottles, then maybe we could use that information to determine how much is left in our own bottles. I wish I would've thought of that before I started using my bottle. At least I'll be able to weigh it after it's empty."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"PdM has a bit of a reputation for making fragrances that replicate other fragrances, and I don’t personally have a problem with it, because in the cases I’m aware of, I think the PdM versions are better. When I sampled TdH Eau Givree, I really wanted to love it, it’s almost perfect, but the dry cedar note (I think it’s the iso e super) was too aggressive and cloying to my nose. I have the same issue with the original edt.Perseus is an almost 1:1 of TdH Eau Givree, but without the aggressive wood note. I mean to say, that they have almost the same woody aspect, but in Perseus it doesn’t feel like sand paper in my nostrils. It’s almost like they read my mind and said, “Hey, here you go, we fixed it.”They definitely copied it, but honestly they kinda perfected it, so you’ll get no arguments from me as far as that goes.This is personal favorite representation of the TdH DNA. Don’t listen to the noise. Go test it. It’s a banger."

It manages to have a strong projecting, longlasting citrus note, which can be hard to manage. It is also incredibly refreshing, and the citrus note is a good balance of multiple fruits, giving the citrus accord itself complexity. However, as for the overall complexity of the fragrance, it is rather simple and linear. You'll get a great, longlasting, projecting citrus note, but that's about it. I'm not sure if it is worth having over other citrus fragrances on the market that can offer something more interesting and less linear."

Smelt like a natural mandarin orange🍊. Took a bath around 5:30 pm and I could still smell it on my wrist after the bath. Wore it as my scent of the day to work (10 sprays at 6 pm). Medium projection for the first 4 hours and was still getting wafts at 6 am in the morning. There was a moment when I thought it was gone but I started getting wafts again. So the lasting power is there 12+ hours and I was sweating a lot and the scent went from my neck to my shirt. Lasts 24 hours as a skin scent. You have blue and green fragrances. This is a orange 🍊 fragrance, no pun intended. I love it. Gave it another wear today 27.09.24. Applied at 6:30 am and was projecting strongly for most of the day. Got a compliment around 12 pm. Co worker was asking if I use Ariel/Breeze to wash my shirt because he's been smelling me for some time and was asking how I got it (the soap powder) to smell so strong on my shirt and if I had dried it inside the washing machine. lol I asked him if it was cologne he was smelling and he said no, it is something soapy. It was Perseus that he was smelling though. A little pass 9 pm and I'm still getting wafts. This is truly a beast of a freshy. Seems the performance has even improved which was already great. I chose this over Percival and I'm glad I did as I have other blue fragrances. Also note when I applied it this morning it was burning my skin where I had applied although the inflammation went a way quickly. Maybe too strong."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I recently tried four (4) fragrances on skin. Perseus on my left hand, the new Chanel on my upper left forearm, Althair or mt right hand, and Creed's Aventus on my upper right forearm. Out of the freshies mentioned, Perseus lasted the longest and projected equally well (Althair was actively at war with the others though, goodness is that a nuke). I am surprised by how much I really love this scent. It is fresh and tart, but it isn't dry (it still has some natural fresh sweetness coming from the fruit, and maybe that tonka?). I am heavily tempted to purchase this and feel like it is their best freshie. I also love Greenley and Percival, Sedley is okay, but I feel like they really hit it out of the park with this one. Might end up being my first full bottle of PDM if it pops up on FragranceBuy under $200.00, but I am also eyeing some other things in that price range so we will see. I am actually surprised this one doesn't get any hype, but I suppose given the fact that it is a fresh fragrance from a house beloved for their sweet/spicy fragrances, as well as the fact that this directly followed the sweet, compliment getting, nuclear bomb of a release that was Althair, that it makes sense. I cannot comment of the Hermes comparisons as I am unfamiliar with that fragrance line. However, what it does remind me of (stay with me now) is like if they made an incredibly fresh, vetiver/grapefruit flanker, of Intense Cedrat Boise. Also kind of like, but much fresher and tarter than, D&G Light Blue Forever. It also performs substantially better than Light Blue Forever. I feel like this is a universal dumb reach like Dior Sauvage, Aventus, Percival, etc."

This perfume does not remind me of Terre d'Hermes, nor does it smell like other vetiver based fragrances. Perseus Is fresh and uplifting, it’s a fragrance that’s meant to make you feel fresh and invigorated. Sometimes I don't want a perfume that is a beast and I want something that I get whiffs of occasionally and Perseus fits the bill nicely. It's a fantastic fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I'm a huge fan of citrus fragrances but I wish they would last longer, there is no sillage, and leave my body very quickly, I would not blindly buy just for that but otherwise for the smell AMAZING, it is like Aqua di Parma in the sense of longevity and smell Overall it would be a 10/10 in smell but like a 3/10 in performance I am disappointed. also, I don't get enough smell to get to the base its just citrus a few plants, and then nothing."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This has a zingy citrus note that lasts forever. Similar to Torino21 on that specific note.I put it yesterday at night, around 22:00, and now 9am I can still faintly smell it on my skin.I cannot compare this to any Terre d'Hermes as I don´t own any, nor to Light Blue Forever because I don´t have any of that line, but it does remind me of both the classic Elysium and the eau intense version, with some tints of Torino 21. It does not smell like any of those scents, it just happens that some notes are similar.Overall, it is a great summer punchy fragrance, it is not redundant if you have Percival, Sedley, or Greenley (these last 2 are for extreme heat, they last just a couple hours and are not very punchy)."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"smells great, if you can get it, even the small bottle for under 140-145 USD, it’s a great buy. Yeah it smells like Terre d’hermes, but it’s way longer lasting, projects significantly more, and smells better."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Smooth citrus that's not like the classic louis vuitton citrus which I find too much and almost stinging my nose. This might be because of the woody nature of this fragrance.Really nice citrusy opening that's really heavy and smooth citrus and dries down into insane woody scent with some citrus still clinging on. My favorite citrus and definitely my top 5 woody.10/10
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,What a lovely fragrance. Really sharp grapefruit pared with a beautiful wood smell. It takes me to a old cabin in the summer time.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"What are you on comparing this to Terre d'Hermes? If you hate Terre (and all its permutations) the same as I do, don't be scared to give Perseus a chance, it's not THAT similar. You can smell the Terre DNA there, but it's like 3% of the whole volume in the background.Very solid release and a DNA that complements the PDM offering nicely.Also, this is not ""just summer day fragrance"" as the voting suggests here. You can definitely wear this all year long."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"One of the better PDM's in the last few years. Beats Kalan and Althair by a mile. They were both boring mediocre releases. Honestly, don't overlook this. It's one of those fragrances you need to give a whole day to, wear it as your scent of the day.I have a bottle and the performance is surprisingly long lasting the the grapefruit persists all the way throughout the fragrance.I've sold all my other grapefruit fragrances and kept this, it's the nicest and best performing of the lot.4/5"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Unfortunately the grapefruit that starts the party reminds me of sweat. When it starts to fade away, the dry down is alright."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Having nearly all the ‘feminine’ leaning scents from PDM in my cabinet, this was a dip in the waters of the ‘masculine’. Having tried Althair - which going by notes I should have adored but was sorely disappointed by - I wasn’t expecting much from this sample. But wow! I am blown away. The initial cool, sharp citrus tang levels out over time and mellows into a beautiful woodsy warmth that, for me, is begging to be layered with a woody vanilla to add just a touch of sweetness. I am now fighting the urge to pull the trigger on a FB - not the right time here in Scotland as we head towards autumn - but would be interesting to see how it performs in cooler weather too. Not that Scotland is tropical currently anyway 😂"

After a sweet and fresh opening, I get creamy fresh grapefruit + vetiver in the dry down which is extremely pleasant.I sense there is Ambroxan in the base, hence keep getting whiffs of the perfume couple of hours after application.This is clean, fresh versatile and office safe.Shukran Habibi!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Love the grapefruit & orange side of Perseus, but the green & woody notes ruin it for me. They make the otherwise great high quality citruses smell way too green and nasty.If you like vetiver you might like this, but personaly I can't stand vetiver as it reminds me of a gross & old & rotten salad that was left in an old moldy basement (Encre Noir ruined vetiver for me)."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I just got a sample of Perseus a couple weeks ago, and I love it so far! I had ordered the Parfums de Marly masculine sample set a while ago, like a month ago maybe, and just wasn't that impressed. I just felt like I had better alternatives already for the ones that I actually liked in the samples I got, which were Althair, Layton Exclusif, Haltane, Greenley, Percival, Layton, Carlisle, Pegasus, and Herod. For example, I really like Greenley and Haltane, but I already own Louis Vuitton Pacific Chill and Ombre Nomade and also Nuit de Feu.But then I went to Nordstrom a couple weeks ago, and my friend who works there gave me a sample of PDM Perseus, and I love that one!!! The bright, vibrant, refreshing grapefruit top note has an almost effervescent effect when I smell it, and the dry down is indescribable. I don't know if it's the ambergris scent note they say is in this fragrance, or if they use Ambroxan or some other artificial scent. I'm not educated enough on the subject to guess. I just know that I love how it smells.Yesterday, I practically doused myself in my LV fragrances before work. I also used one spray of Perseus on the back of my left hand. All day at work, I couldn't stop smelling my left hand! It smells so good!!!Edit on July 31, 2024: I got my order from PDM a few days ago, including the 75 ml bottle of Perseus! I've been using it for the past few days, and it's quickly become one of my favorite fragrances. So far, I think my favorite layering combo is either just with Mancera Instant Crush, or with Tom Ford Noir Extreme EDP, or with Azzaro The Most Wanted Parfum and Intense EDP, or with Louis Vuitton Ombre Nomade. The bright, uplifting grapefruit in Perseus REALLY compliments those scents."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It doesn't smell like anything else I've tried. It's definitely nothing like terre Dhermes imo. My wife and daughter both thought it smelled like paint, kind of like turpentine. I didn't love it so I'm glad I didn't blind buy this.Strangely I layered this with Polo Earth and it smelled exactly like Gentle Fluidity Silver 🤔"

Y'all are full of shit. Perseus stands alone nothing smells like it. It is so dam good love it. People lie like hell 😂
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"After reading reviews, I was sceptical about this being my first PDM fragrance but alas I had saw it was a good for a summery fragrance and wanted to go for something not as common as the other PDM, also considering it released this year it would be a more current fragrance in my collection.I love it, the opening notes are the highlight of this fragrance as once you spray it instantly hits with the fruity notes. It's a good fragrance that I definitely recommend but the price is daunting in PDM fashion and you could go for other fragrances with more interesting and powerful notes especially for summer fragrances but Perseus is still a great fragrance"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This absolutely is similar to TDH but not nearly as smooth or appealing. There is almost a medicinal quality to it in the first several minutes. Not sure this will be in the rotation as I can't imagine reaching for this over my TDH when I want that vibe.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Had a chance to test it at shop today. Not a fan of it and probably not going to try it again, but longevity and sillage is fantastic. 8h, gym and a shower later ir still radiates of my arm I sprayed twice. Beast mode fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"At first I was a bit skeptical about Perseus due to some reviews I read... when I tested it on my skin I was immediately hooked. The opening is absolutely fantastic with a burst of juicy Grapefruit which is dominant even in the dry down... the vetiver used for this fragrance is a perfect match and supports the fresh citrus notes.On my skin Perseus is a beast and lasts easily 12 to 14 hours... If you live in a hot environment, this fragrance will shine the higher the temperatures get (I'm based in Thailand so it's always hot here)It has some similarities with Light Blu Forever but is so much better than D&G.... don't listen to the haters, this PDM release is incredible!"

Great longevity and high quality. It stands alone it does not smell like nothing else. People are full of shit. These sites are full of shit on the ratings. I know it is higher than this. You can't believe these sites anyway. People will rate something that they don't even have. They know it is a popular name and going to hate.

But TDH Eau Fraiche (TDHEF) is hands down the worst fragrance I have ever smelled. This smells more like TDHEF but not AS bad. I rated TDHEF as 1/10 the only fragrance I have ever given that low of a rating too, but I would say this is 4.5/10. Maybe 5/10."

Very realistic, but too sharp for me. Its perfect for a younger crowd, for days like this, where heat is just insane. But too sharp and strong for my nose sadly.EDIT (a day later): This is fantastic, i dont think this is a copy of TDH, this is all about realistic juicy grapefruit. Its perfect for summer, seriously, try it. Ignore the haters, this is an actual great PDM together with Herod, Carlisle and Layton."

This is a fantastic fragrance. It doesn’t smell like most of the fragrances people claim it reminds them of. However, there is 5% similarity to TDH but even with that, to catch a whiff of TDH , you would have to be actively sniffing past the ambergris just so you can get that grapefruit and if you’re doing that then you’re on a hate project."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The opening is indeed a great splash of grapefruit and quickly after the entry, a dry vetiver is in the game. I get a lot of woods and the lovely marine ambergris too.Overall you’re left with a continual bright citrus (which is impressive), vetiver, marine-like scent which is effervescent and refreshing while remaining grounded.It’s a fantastic scent. The only gripe I have is that the bottle should have been yellow and clear, much like their other fresh scents such as greenley and sedley.Perseus and Neroli Sauvage by Creed have a similar vibe to me. Both a bursting citrus and ambergris which is predominantly running the show. However this has more complexity from the woods.Wore my sample twice this weekend and my girlfriend loved it and so did I.When we were napping she said I smelled like the Mediterranean in Italy during the day. Citrus and the sea. I have to agree."

Perseus stands alone and does not smell like this and that. I put it beside the ones that people say it smells like and it doesn't smell like none of them. Y'all are full of shit.

I love everything niche, from animalic stuff to heavy incense frags and I have searched far and wide for summer frags, and I will say is a great one, so don't listen to anyone who says this is bad, try it for yourself. and for people to say it's just a glorified clone of Terre de Hermes, then what is Isola Blu or Basso by Sospiro, People just want to hate because it's popular to hate on PDM right now."

Look it's not unpleasant but at +£200 per bottle I'd want more, quickly became a close skin scent that yes did stay around for hours but you had to put your nose to it to pick it up.

Whereas TdH is described as being a ""dirty orange"", this is a very bright grapefruit intensified with vetiver. Strictly for daytime use only, it's as bright as its bottle.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Perseus does have a similar scent profile to the opening of Terre D’Hermes and compares almost to the likes of Elysium as well as a couple other fragrances. However, Perseus does have its own unique twist and last much longer than the others. It’s definitely worth getting from discounters and I agree the retail price of this fragrance is not worth it. There is a great quality, performance and a great fragrance profile behind Perseus even if it does share similar DNA with others. To me I prefer Perseus over the others as the performance is much better."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Very few fragrances have got me as excited as this one. Absolutely sublime spring/summer scent. I ordered a sample and was immediately ready to purchase a full bottle within the first 5 minutes--the opening was that ethereal. But I held back and waited for the a full day to see how it developed and performed. By that evening I was even more excited to order a full bottle. It really mellowed out nicely over the course of the day, with the wood notes really picking up as it moved into the evening hours. 6-8 hours of very solid performance and then it transitioned into something calmer, darker (well, compared to the original brightness of the opening), and sultry. This is the perfect scent to apply in the afternoon for summer, let it do it's warm, citrusy, playful things...and then let it transition into that woody/grassy evening scent that is perfect for watching a sunset or drinks on a patio. This is seriously a masterpiece."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This stuff is like scented sunshine and it grew on me like crazy. If last year’s Althair was vanilla heaven, Perseus is the citrus equivalent. Its easy to dismiss this as a niche take on the Terre D’Hermes dna (it kinda is, though definitely has its own vibe), but this is so much smoother and refined to my nose. That initial grapefruit blast in the opening is one of the most photorealistic notes I’ve ever smelled in a fragrance, and I find it highly addictive. Juicy and bittersweet. The citrus in Perseus somehow never really fades completely on my skin and it blends beautifully with the cashmere wood and vetiver in the drydown. It pleasantly reminds me of citrus groves in California and how the air smells around them at dusk when they’re giving off that lovely aroma. Anyway this one is just super clean and put together. Definitely gentlemanly and a very solid release with equally solid performance. This wafts so nicely in the drydown and it will be getting a ton of wear this summer. And the bottle is one of my favorite PDM’s, just a gorgeous solar yellow color which totally matches the scent. 🌞"

The fragrance itself is nice, nothing revolutionary or new, but nice. Is very fresh and zesty citrics perfect for summer days. I dont know if it was the sample I got or what BUT this really lacks performance. I know freshies and citrusy fragrances usually have poor performance and longevity BUT at this price range everybody would expect for AT LEAST !! 6 hours of longevity. I got like 45 minutes of projection and like 3 hours MAX in my skin like putting my nose DIRECTLY TO MY SKIN. It sort of gave me the Vibe that MOLECULE 01 by itself gives in my skin. Maybe Perseus might be a good layer option for citrus fragrances I dont know, but I wouldn't pay all that money for a layer frag. This perfume doesnt gives me PDM style. IMO this tend to lean more towards Acqua Di Parma sort of creations in their Blue Bottles line. In Conclusion .... IT IS A GOOD SCENT, but not worth the price. To Be Honest I wouldn't Pay more than $70 for this. There are WAY MORE BETTER OPTIONS out there for 1/4th of the price."

The lemon is extremely strong and makes the entire perfume come together perfectly. I got a 2ml sample for 15€ I think I underpaid cuz this stuff is amazing. 9/10. Only downside is price, but perfume is high quality and mind blowing."

I've had a friend wear it to make sure I was smelling it correctly and after an hour i couldnt smell unless my nose is directly on the skin. This isnt worth the value to me. Cool to have but i would return it to Saks if i could.Very much a citrus in the beginning, but dries down to a woody/tea type of smell."

Love pdm,initio love this house my favorite. I'm not far from having them all. They did dam good on perseus and trust me people will say it smells like this. Guess what it doesn't that is how I know people are leaving false reviews. I understand the blast of citrus and grapefruit but it doesn't smell like no other. Put it side by side and you will see"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This is just parfums de marly doing what they do best great unique fragrances with there own style and dna I love this after a few days of spraying it I felt the same about kalan initially not sure. But man this is simply stunning it has that creamy feel that alot of pdms have especially layton kalan haltane. I love this house they are beautiful fragrances I have 14 in my collection. If you wear perseus during the summer you will stand out the dry down is heaven. Anyone comparing this to designer freshies are sadly mistaken this is niche perfumery with high quality ingredients and naturals
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I got a free sample of this with an online order and it's a nice fragrance, nothing ground breaking by any means that would blow people away like Herod did the first time I wore it or most shills on social media and youtube claim they are like with Layton. This is just another designer smelling scent at a niche price tag.I can see where people are coming from with Terre D'Hermes. The burst of citrus in the opening of TDH but besides that no other similarities. If anything it also reminds me of Bvlgari Tygar / Afnan Turathi Blue where someone took all the blue fragrance like elements out of that fragrance. Perhaps some elements of Dior Sport 2021 I vaguely remember testing it in a department store minus the presence of aldehydes giving off that fresh linen smell. As it dries down it becomes more calm, more sparkly or fizzy but nothing like WOW I need to order the largest bottle of this possible!This doesn't deserve the price tag it has. Nothing about this smells expensive regardless of how natural the ingredients smell or any other claims to get those zeroes in the price tag could ever change my opinion. This one is for the collectors who want to own the rest of their fragrances or the ""elitists"" that will only wear PDM (as if most will notice). However to someone who doesn't care if something is niche or not they can and will easily find a similar fragrance for a fraction of the price that does the same job. Even if this was ""beast mode"" and got 12+ hours I still couldn't recommend it.This was designed as a very expensive dumb reach, a casual fragrance for warm weather,. I can see why this was included in the line. It's a day time scent, nothing sophisticated as that was never the intention, there's nothing challenging where you can wear this about as often as you'll put a Christmas tree up or Halloween decorations like some niche fragrances. Anyone could pull this off from rich kids spending their parents money to a CEO of a successful company. Anything night time oriented, formal or date night try something else by PDM or Initio."

To my nose, and olfactory senses are subjective so please take with a grain of salt, this smells like Elysium. Unlike Roja Doves' reformulations this is the first potent batch of the good stuff with all of the pros.If you like Elysium and wish it to be stronger, use this.I get great longevity. Sillage is big for the first two hours and then about an arms length for hours 2-6. After that, this is a nice skin scent.Performs well in high heat.As for other scents that smell like this...Elysium is the closest twin.

The dry down is a smooth orange smell that turns into a light floral as it dries down. Amazing profile, parfum performance ( sits really close ), and is WAY too expensive for what it is."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Zesty and realistic grapefruit opening. The bright citrus doesn't last that long but then it transforms into more vetiver/woodsy and that will last a long time. It doesn't disappear like so many citrus fragrances because the woodsy notes, you will still smell it after a shower. I get nose blind after 1-2hours and think it's gone but it isn't. The projection is about arms length or less in the dry down. I really don't get the TDH comparison because they are nothing alike, not at all. Overall for me it is very positive and uplifting fragrance, it just makes me happy."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Smells like a juicy grapefruit with a nice woody touch not too feminine in my opinion very nice scent. the opening is a very strong grapefruit then on the dry-down the wood starts to come out. after a couple hours the wood and ambergris are the main scents remaining but you still get a little touch of the bergamot and grapefruit. do recommend.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Feels like odor you get when you squeeze a mandarin peel. I also caught a sense of yuzu vibe as well. Very clean zest. Since it feels fo clean, it almost feels like it has some greenness. I'm definately a big fan of this scent. Although it's contains citrus, it doesn't feel fruity(sweet) which makes it wearable for all gender in all season."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Loved this one at first spray, but the sugary citrus notes die down a bit too quickly and you’re left with the wood and ambergris base, which A. Is a bit too boring for me and B. Kind of annoys me because it gets on to clothing and builds up on skin. I love Marly, but it feels like they only thought of the top notes, and there’s very little connecting the top to the base. As a result I love to smell this one but don’t wear it as often as I want. When I smelled it the first time I was in love, but the top notes sold me on a perfume that is barely connected to them. Regardless it’s nice, and it is very similar to Terre Dhermes, but just a bit more “candied” annd unisex. It’s more suitable for spring rather than fall. I don’t regret buying it, I just would probably make some tweaks."

Smells a little artificial and forced. Nearly for the same price, I would prefer Bvlgari Tygar for sure. More subtle and balanced imo."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I was surprised by how much I like this. Clean and fresh citrus with vetiver. It’s hardly ground breaking but it manages to smell bright and sharp and kinda natural (I mean it smells like something in nature rather than a comment on the amount of naturals used) and performance is pretty decent if not mind blowing. It’s substantially easier to love than the bunch of other attempts at “stronger TDH” like Sospiro Adnante (or whatever it is now) and the Montale Red Vetiver. Solid take on citrus Vetiver.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Update to my original review. Been wearing on hotter days to see performance. Unfortunately not very good. I work in office and maybe 4 hours max on my skin. The scent is ok, not a standout.

Y'all are full of shit and this is better than elysium and Terre d'Hermès all day. Great release by pdm. Pdm,initio gets hate on like creed but you can't take away the best. Also perseus does not smell like elysium or Terre d'hermes nothing alike. Perseus is better"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I know this sounds dramatic but i would literally not wear this even if i was gifted this. It's not like its just not my style of fragrance, it seriously smells bad. Super sour grapefruit from start to finish which by itself isnt bad at all, but with the almost animalic wild musk undertone it smells sour, mineralic animal. Maybe ambergris.The only thing i can compare this to is eau givree by Hermés. Perseus smells like a perfumery student tried to recreate Eau Givree from mind and it spilled musk in the mix. I rarely write reviews on the fragrances i dislike, but the hype on this is crazy"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is a great fragrance. Many comparisons are thrown with Eau Givree, but as an owner of Eau Givree, the similarities end at the opening. Eau Givree is a lot more rind-y, sharper because of the mineral notes, and is more sour, turns slightly sweet but stays pretty linear seemingly adding some woodiness with the citrus throughout.Perseus is different; though the opening is a similar grapefruit (Givree is Citron) it quickly changes into something more: the woods and the aromatic notes soften the fragrance, juxtaposing the opening. Both are unique in their own way, Givree is more effervescent and sparkly, while Perseus is more refined and elegant in its own right, and I see no reason to bash one over the other.The performance seems good, considering it's fresh, but it doesn't project as much as you have to spend. I'd love to buy it myself but the price tag is a little up there, especially when I have Givree; different enough to garner attention and worth putting your nose on, but not enough to justify spending $300 for 2/3 of a different scent."

I first got Greenley & Haltane. I went back a couple weeks later to get Sedley & Perseus had just came out. They were trying to tell me its brand new & I wasn’t very interested. They sprayed it on me & I didnt like it. 30 minutes later has it dried down the scent just went so well with my skin & I live in So Cal so the sun is usually out. This scent is so unique & perfect to me for my skin & environment. 9/10 fragrance. If you try it, try it on your skin, let it dry down & see if you like it!"

Scent profile is great and smells of high quality2. Performance is Beast mode (for a freshie 8h+)3. It’s versatile4. It gets compliments5. Would I pay retail for it hell no ( I wouldnt pay retail for anything) 😂While in the same “style” of terre de Hermes this is for sure it’s own fragrance and smells nothing like it. And their is definitely and aventus esque smell in the background somewhere in here (probably the way the ambergris/black currant is used)If this was an LV or Sospiro it would be the best thing since sliced bread 🤷🏽♂️😂
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The opening is similar to TDH Eau Givree but it’s mainly the grapefruit/ citrus and vetiver combo that remind you of TDH Eau Givree. The dry down on this is very similar to Elysium PC but Perseus is much more musky and a bit sweet and Elysium is a bit more green and less musky. Perseus though projects and lasts way longer than Elysium. I got to say I am not very fond of the opening and the first 30-40 mins until it gets to that far dry down, that’s when the magic happens. It’s a bit more feminine leaning/ unisex than Elysium, but good nonetheless. If you don’t get to that 45 min. far dry down and don’t try it on skin, you are not really getting to know Perseus. For those of you that have only smelled the opening and compared it to TDH Eau Givree or D&G light blue forever, you are not wrong in that it is reminiscent of those scents but only in the opening and that's it. It is a completely different scent in the dry down compared to Eau Givree and D&G light blue forever, Perseus is way better."

I love PDM Layton but it’s not suitable for humid hot summer days. tried this, but was very disappointed. not worth it at all. smells just like a air freshener for a bathroom or car. 👎"

I did compare them, and I do see where people are coming from. They get the vetiver, and right off, they are alike bull shit they are different if you give it time dam people. Me Perseus is better than both of them. Elysium and Terre d'Hermès have more of a stronger vetiver. Perseus is so clean. The opening you get it all and that drydown man I get them woods notes and clean musk love it so good. A lot of y'all leaves a review and doesn't even have it, lol. Y'all cry too dam much.

I thought it was close to TDH and TDH givree so I sampled those and these are way off. The original TDH smells dated like a combination of Tuxedo and Givree and Givree is just lemon. That was the moment I decided to order a bottle. It is fresh, great sillage and has really good performance (Trust me, I am a PDM hater in terms of performance). I also have D&G forever and I understand that people think it's close. To me, D&G forever is more complex with an oregano / spicy Italian note in it but I agree on the grapefruit. Perseus seems like a very simple creation but it's done really really well and in the air it is gorgeous!Beside that… look at the bottle and the color! So beautiful.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Perseus smells very refreshing and uplifting. The grapefruit is strong in the opening but calms down a bit in the drydown. The performance of this one is stellar, though. It literally lasts all day and some. I sprayed it on my arm at noon yesterday and as I’m writing this review at 11:05AM the next day, I still smell it on my arm. This offers unreal performance, especially for a freshie!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I have to leave another review on this one because my initial one didn't sum up how truly lackluster this is. I tried something new this morning and went to the gym before school (I am 17 y/o and a senior in high school) and this was my choice of fragrance to apply because I had a tester I hadn't touched in a month since I received it. Sprayed it on my wrist once, and let my friend smell it, he said it smelled like tart hand sanitizer, (I mostly agree) but it was all I had so I put 3 more sprays on my neck. After about 10 minutes I pretty much just only picked up lame grapefruit and isopropyl alcohol. Opinions are subjective but this just sucks 😂. If it's your taste, go wild and write about how great it is...but if you've never tried it, stay away, not worth a penny for a sample. If anyone offered me a 4.2 of this for any more than $50 I probably would not take it. Lasted 3 hours. Sucks."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I’m reviewing Perseus for a third and final time now because I ordered a full bottle and the scent is different from the sample.I sprayed 4 sprays on my neck and 2 on my shirt. The opening is a burst of juicy, bitter, zesty grapefruit. This authentic grapefruit opening gets weaker after 30 minutes as the vetiver begins to come through to create a fresh musky smell. After about an hour, the orange starts to shine. The orange is sweet and very fresh. Spraying from the bottle is different from the 1ml sample. I couldn’t smell the orange with the sample, however with the full bottle you can really smell the sweetness of the orange.The woods start to emerge in the dry down, but everything blends together perfectly to create a scent that is very fresh, slightly citrusy, slightly floral, and slightly musky.I find that the projection is moderate, but works better in its sillage. People at work asked if I was wearing a new aftershave, and said it smelled fresh. Someone even said it smells sweet and smells like a summer night fragrance. Someone also asked at the end of the day if I resprayed it, but my only spray was at 8am!I agree that the sample was a grapefruit and vetiver bomb! However, the bottle is a more subtle and wel-blended scent. This fragrance would work perfectly in the summer breeze. I don’t have a summer fragrance, so I’m happy with the purchase!"

Trust me don’t do it. This is a skin scent in one hour. Not really unique distinct at all. Check out my reviews, you’ll see that I very rarely leave a negative review of any fragrance, but this stuff is watered down Citrus, you can spray it on your skin and you will barely see a layer of oil show up on the back of your hand if you were to do so. I bought the large bottle took it back. Very surprising for this house it’s like they were bought by Bath and body Works or something and decided to sell everybody a $400 bottle of lemon water"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Perseus smells just like Terre D'Hermes Eau Intense Vetiver except it's slightly more tangier (grapefruit and black currant combo) and comes off as less mature/dated (the geranium, while there, isn't as pronounced in this). To my surprise my girlfriend liked the sample I have. Definitely smells better on skin than in the air or paper. Not quite sure how much I like this, still need to try in high heat, but it's definitely not as bad as some of the other reviews make it out to be. For now, I'll give it a 7.5/10EDIT 6/19/24 - Perseus is everything I was told Terre D'Hermes would be. Whereas TdH is described as being a ""dirty orange"", this is a very bright grapefruit intensified with vetiver. Strictly for daytime use only, but this performs very well considering its high price tag. Not worth the price still, but certainly a good offering from PdM. 8.5/10"

All three smell fresh and fantastic, but I can’t see myself wearing Sedley in high heat as it’s a bit heavy to my nose. Greenley is definitely the most light freshie out of the three, and I like the mixture of apple and moss - smells like a fresh meadow. Will have to test run Greenley to make a decision between Greenley and Perseus.Perseus is linear yet very strong, and very masculine. You could wear it on a boat party and stand out from everyone else, and is definitely a scent you can wear in high heat."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Really bright grapefruit/lemon fresh scent to begin with but doesn't have the staying power or sillage the other PDMs have. Loses a lot of price justification when both of these aspects are subpar which is generally the opposite of what I've come to find with this brand. Personally have Sedley and find that a nice contrast in fresh/summer scent but far better longevity and sillage.Mrs also has PDM Delina that she wore on the same day I wore Perseus, hers lasted all day with minimal top up while I had to top up several times during a special occasion.Overall I really enjoy the scent but I wouldn't recommend buying a full bottle for the current performance."

It's not awful but is in the bottom tier of PDM freshies. Zingy citrus in the opening that dries down to a boring woody base.This smells nothing like Elysium or its Eau Intense flanker, to those who are curious.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I was excited upon hearing that PDM was launching a new scent, and on top of that was going to be freshie. PDM explained that their goal in crafting Perseus was to create a long-lasting citrus fragrance. I went to my local niche-fragrance shop and sprayed some on a testing-strip; my excitement vanished instantly.I knew from the ads on their Instagram page that grapefruit was going to be the focal point of Perseus, but in my opinion, they went about it all the wrong way. Before Perseus, the most authentic smelling grapefruit-inspired fragrance I had ever smelled was Light Blue Forever. It literally smells like a freshly cut, ripe and juicy grapefruit. Perseus however, is the most bitter grapefruit imaginable. This reminds me less of summer, and more of a businessman about two years away from retirement.The vetiver note doesn't help things either. Vetiver is the usual pairing-partner with citruses, but it completely backfires here. The opening is the most tolerable part of Perseus. The dry-down becomes a harsh, bitter nightmare (no doubt due to the vetiver). I find it smells like printer toner on that carbon printing paper, with the tearaway holes on the side; just bitter and synthetic. (Have I said bitter enough yet?)I think that had PDM added a sweeter note to balance out the sharpness of vetiver, it could've been a much different experience. Something like a coconut, vanilla, or even a blueberry note would've helped immensely here. If they wanted to keep notes in theme of the colour of the bottle, mango was right there! Do not blind-buy!"

Opening is a blast of juicy citrus, vetiver soon follows, then the dry down is a blend of woody / citrusy / ambroxy goodness.

It's very fresh and zingy. As someone not much into citrus, I find it very appealing and I could see myself wearing it... until the vetiver rearing its head. I honestly don't get along with vetiver and an hour in, vetiver takes over and it's all I can smell anymore, that familiar burnt ashen wood vibe. I can't deal with it. Shame, as the opening is amazing. Those into citrusy vetiver fragrances like TF's Grey Vetiver (although Perseus is way juicier), Terre d'Hermes and Light Blue will dig this one."

Sprayed it on my hand and had the same experience, not to mention the fact I couldn't even smell a trace of it 2 hours later. The scent is okay but not worth the price tag. Don't know if I'd justify parting with $100 for this, let alone $200+. It's not a bad release, just not on par with the others.Scent- 6.5/10Longevity- 5/10Sillage- 5/10Price- 4/10 (retail)"

It's grapefruit and vetiver. Great blend. You smell all of the other ingredients but grapefruit and vetiver are the main players. If you want a fruitier TDH this is for you. I really like it but as someone who is trying to not amass over 100 bottles I'll have to pass for now at least.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Just to comment on the review below: I thought he was full of crap because I have Hermes Eau d'Orange Verte and didn’t think they smelled similar. So, wearing Perseus (which my wife is mad about, she hates it) I sprayed some HEDOV and I do see a connection. But in place of the weird vinyl-ish “dry citrus peel” that resembles terre d’hermes, HEDOV has a pleasant, more natural smelling almost lime character. Perseus is way more synthetic and annoying. I stand by my original review below where I say it smells a bit like mosquito repellent.And PS, the comparisons to Eau Givree are pretty funny; obviously these people only know Eau Givree and not the original Terre d’Hermes or they wouldn’t be making that comparison."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Not bad... The opening is nice, like an EDP version of Hermes Eau d'Orange Verte, but this quickly dries down to something kinda generic and not that exciting, this stage also comes across as not very well blended, the green/vetiver note sticks out and is distinctly separate from the citrus and basenotes. After a while the fragrance improves and becomes more cohesive, the blackcurrant adds a bit of sweetness and the citrus and green notes blend together in a way that isn't so disjointed. Others to consider are Puredistance Aenotus and Roja Apex, both focus on citrus with green notes, and both are overall better. As mentioned, Eau d'Orange Verte is a similar cologne, more mossy and not as tenacious. Terre d'Hermes is also in the neighborhood, but with a ton of iso-e that gives it a different character. I also prefer Bvlgari Tygar, it has a really nice grapefruit note, but it doesn't have the green aspect. I've found the PdMs I've tried a strange mishmash of notes that seem like amateur creations compared to more polished offerings from other brands."

I can never get sick of these 2 frags ( they’re totally unrelated.)I’m surprised no one mentioned the PDM Galloway dna in this.

I wasn’t going to buy this based on previous reviews but an online frag buddy talked me into trying it. I blind bought a 4.2 oz bottle and after wearing it, I ordered a backup bottle. I’ve only ever done that with Tygar and Oud MaracuJá. Definitely the best from PDM to me. I need a lifetime supply of it.

They smell citrus and ambergris and think it smells like Elysium. There’s no resemblance here, just stop. Anyway, as far as citruses go this is at least kind of unique. I’m not sure I like it a whole lot but this is just a first impression. The grapefruit/bergamot comes off a bit dry and bitter and I can see some vague comparison to TdH as far as the citrus goes. The geranium is noticeable and with the bitter citrus kind of gives off a weird vinyl effect. I like weird stuff and the vinyl doesn’t bother me but it’s definitely not what I expected. With the vinyl I can kind of imagine this as a bergamot version of cyber garden, and then I find it interesting. Of course there’s quite a bit of ambroxan so the Bros will like it and get their compliments. (I swear there are people out there that’ll compliment a turd if it’s covered in ambroxan.)Second application:I really hate when people compare fragrances to cleaning products and such but I have to say this: I feel like I just applied mosquito repellent. I love citrus fragrances but this is just dry and synthetic and irritating. I just watched some YouTube reviews and I have no idea where they’re coming from. I didn’t think Ash was a sellout but his review made me suspicious. Looks like he started the Elysium thing, too. I guess this is supposed to give a mature vibe and the dry woody character was how they attained its substantial longevity, as well. Maybe this is PdM trying to fit the “niche” category better, but I can’t see this being a crowd pleaser, nor a niche pleaser. This may be attractive to PdM fanboys who think it smells mature. The dryness and irritating bug spray effect means this probably won’t be the “hot weather” banger people think it will be. This is probably a spring or fall scent.Far dry down, hours later: Honestly this is better when the bug-spray citrus burns off. What's left is a much less offensive geranium vetiver woody thing. Still, not great, and closer to TdH at this point."

There's a kind of ""damp woods"" smell to me that distracts from the really beautiful grapefruit notes. This seems to tone down after the opening hour or so but it's not something I'd pay full price for - especially when there are other fragrances similar to this that I like more.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Perseus is a citrus-infused counterpart to Terre d'Hermes (TDH) with a bit of Elysium tucked away in there.Perseus opens up with a smooth citrus, different from the juicy citrus notes found in Louis Vuitton and the sharper citrus notes found in Xerjoff fragrances. The scent transforms with the emergence of vetiver, lending a green quality. While it may not break new ground, Perseus is an expertly crafted blend with high-quality ingredients, typical of PDM, and at a reasonable price point.Honestly, there is nothing to dislike - I actually quite enjoy the scent. The only reason I'm not adding it to my collection is because it feels redundant next to TDH, which I already own.However, for those unfamiliar with TDH or dedicated PDM fans seeking a modern twist, Perseus offers a compelling option.Among PDM's summer offerings, Perseus stands out, alongside the bittersweetness of Greenly, the aromatic charm of Percival, and the versatile freshness of Sedley. If you're a fan of vetiver, Perseus is definitely one to consider.I'll be picking this one up on a discount or once I've exhausted my TDH.8.5/10"

Really quite nice and the dry down is just as good as the opening. Smells very similar to tdh eau givree though. Similar enough that it would be redundant to own if you already have tdh. This is definitely a higher caliber than eau givree in terms of ingredient quality and performance. But I don’t think I’ll be adding this one to my collection any time soon. Discounter prices is a hard yes though.Update: the performance on this is absurd for a freshie. I thought Mefisto and LB forever were good performers. Twelve hours + and a shower later I’m still getting Perseus’ dry down off my neck. If you want a beast mode freshie, this is it."

I agree with some comments below that this is much closer to Terra EDT than anything Elysium. Ok performance. Just an ok fragrance all around. I won’t be buying.To the comment below about PDM quitting freshies - just stop. That’s nonsense. Sedley, Greenley, and Percival are all great summer fragrances. They missed a little on this one. Don’t indict all of them. It’s a stupid take.Sedley has a 4.21. Greenley has a 4.24. Percival has a 4.24. Those scores all have thousands of votes. You sound like an idiot."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Most of the reviews below are trash because they're just shitting on Perseus and calling it mid/trash because it's PDM. Which isn't fair. Especially because I'd suspect many people hating on it don't even have a bottle (as of this writing, it's not available for sale and very difficult to get your hands on).I was able to snag a bottle of Perseus early, and so I actually have smelled this and worn a few days.This is one of those fragrances where you need to wait for the dry down, and also smelling it in the air is better than up close.I'll be honest, the initial spray has a light resemblance to bug spray, which could be a bit off-putting to some.You must enjoy vetiver and grapefruit to like this fragrance.The two are incredibly blended.At first, I thought it was 70:30 vetiver to grapefruit, but after a few days with it, I'd say it feels more like 60:40 or even 55:45. The vetiver is strong.Projection I'd say is very solid, especially for the first 4-5 hours.Longevity, from me this is an 8-9 hour fragrance.Due to the use of vetiver, this pushes out and the sillage is very good with it.Age range I'd put on this fragrance is 30's and up, or an incredibly mature late 20's dude. Very masculine, and it'll be hard to see this falling into the unisex space. I wouldn't want my wife to wear this, personally.I understand why people are making the Aventus, Vibrato and Tygar comparisons (because the notes mention grapefruit and vetiver), but once you actually smell this and compare, scents are worlds apart. It's not even close. It's like comparing apples and oranges. Having smelled Perseus, if somebody asks ""does this smell like Aventus????"" I would just laugh them out of the room.The only fragrance that this actually smells close to is Terre D'Hermes (and anything out that's really similar to it.).Even closer, Terre D'Hermes Eau Intense Vetiver. In my opinion, there's a pl;ace for Perseus and in some ways, it's more pleasurable to wear than Terre D'Hermes.The opening is a bit harsh, but the dry down is great. Sillage is good!This is going to be great in the Summer.Worth buying a bottle to me."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Parfums-de-Marly/Perseus-90199.html,Perseus Parfums de Marly cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It's a bit sad how many ""comments"" below are not actual reviews. What inspires someone to write in the review section about something they haven't tried, especially in a negative way, simply because you read the notes?I received my bottle 2 days ago direct from PDM, so at least I've earned the right to speak. It was expensive. It is PDM. If you complain about this, buy Versace, it's cheaper. In my opinion, the price is worth it. I have 17 bottles of PDM and strongly believe very few brands compare. Perseus is excellent and falls somewhere in the middle of the PDM pack. I hate to say it but there are strong similarities here to Terre d' Hermes. Perseus is more sweet and playful. The vetiver is strong and often considered a mature note but a younger person can wear this one, whereas TDH is usually attracting an older crowd. The citrus notes are extremely natural and equally share the stage with the vetiver. If there was one negative (to me), this is not overly unique or original. All in all, I like it a lot. Performance is classic PDM. It fills the room and lasts all day."

PDM explained that their goal in crafting Perseus was to create a long-lasting citrus fragrance. I went to my local niche-fragrance shop and sprayed some on a testing-strip; my excitement vanished instantly.I knew from the ads on their Instagram page that grapefruit was going to be the focal point of Perseus, but in my opinion, they went about it all the wrong way. Before Perseus, the most authentic smelling grapefruit-inspired fragrance I had ever smelled was Light Blue Forever. It literally smells like a freshly cut, ripe and juicy grapefruit. Perseus however, is the most bitter grapefruit imaginable. This reminds me less of summer, and more of a businessman about two years away from retirement.The vetiver note doesn't help things either. Vetiver is the usual pairing-partner with citruses, but it completely backfires here. The opening is the most tolerable part of Perseus. The dry-down becomes a harsh, bitter nightmare (no doubt due to the vetiver). I find it smells like printer toner on that carbon printing paper, with the tearaway holes on the side; just bitter and synthetic. (Have I said bitter enough yet?)I think that had PDM added a sweeter note to balance out the sharpness of vetiver, it could've been a much different experience. Something like a coconut, vanilla, or even a blueberry note would've helped immensely here. If they wanted to keep notes in theme of the colour of the bottle, mango was right there! Do not blind-buy!"

In Mexico there are some gummy candies called Panditas, which remind me of that. It is a pleasant smell that is partially reminiscent of Uomo Born in Roma. A few minutes later a slightly woody coffee accord appears, like that of a cream or coffee liqueur, although it never becomes the main chord, because that role is dominated by some sweet fruit. Some note of vanilla is also noticeable in its final phase.Green Stravanganza is a fragrance for daily use, in a temperate climate, in spring, autumn and winter, and in summer except on very warm days, due to the sweetness it has. I think a young audience will really like it, but people of any age could try it. It could be worn at school, casual outings both day and night.Its longevity was not bad, it lasted about 8 hours on me, but its sillage is a bit close to the skin."

I've been testing this scent on and off for a long while now, have had a couple of samples. I find it both simple but strangely compelling, it's something new but at the same time quite familiar. I really do like it a lot. I also found that it lasts frankly longer than I would've expected on paper strips/clothing.Green Stravaganza has that feel-good vibe of Tommy Hilfiger 'Cologne', the OG. It shares some of that bright fruity citrus and vetiver but this Valentino smoothes things out and with that lightly amber coffee note. I wonder how it would smelled if they'd added a touch of mint? Perhaps in a future edition, given there are so many flankers these days...A modern twist on a classic summer scent, worth checking out if you can justify the relatively high prices for such a fragrance.

Pero cuando ya lo has desmembrado yrepites huso, le empiezas a encontrar esos matizantes escondidos, que parecía carecer y sin embargo, le reconoces que hay un buen trabajo perfumístico profesional rellenándo sus entresijos con una bergamota juguetona, un café bien construido y un vetiver que funciona decentemente.Para ser una versión que no tendrá relevancia más allá de su uso en verano, acabas agradeciendo que no sea una fragancia azul y que sea de estructura clásica pero de acabados dulces actuales.Una variante que puede dar buen juego por su mezcla un tanto disparatada, que, aunque no tiene densidad ni potencia, puede ser ese aroma distintivo de las calurosas noches de verano, ya que, las grandes composiciones densas y amaderadas, mejor dejarlas para el otoño-invierno.Un fouguere refrescante que se siente punzante, limpio y suave cuando se asienta en piel. De salida explosiva y expansiva, que no tiene notas intensas de las que te puedan agobiar con calor. Y ahí su ventaja ya que si lo hubiesen potenciado más ya no sería refrescante y esa sensación dulzona acabaría por darte dolores de cabeza.Si no te gusta a la primera como a mí, te recomiendo variar los sitios donde lo apliques, porque funciona mejor en ropa que en piel.Un aroma que parece desaparecer después de sus primeros y escandalosos instantes, pero que se queda, en una verde burbuja personal, bastante tiempo y desodoriza muy bien con su corazón de café y su fondo fresco de vetiver.Si eres un amante de los buenos perfumes, este no vale la pena ni provarlo. Es una versión juvenil dulzona, de bajo coste] y precio de venta elevado para su cantidad y calidad aromática.Hecho para hacer caja, por nombre de marca y de perfumistas. (Algo normal en estos tiempos).Supongo que los perfumistas se habrán divertido con las mezclas y estará lleno de sintéticos para vender con gran margen de beneficios las tres primeras temporadas, (si llega a aguantar tanto) .Después del aroma azul...

I do agree that the performance could be better and it does lack in complexity, but the scent dna is still so unique. An amber like coffee with a fresh accord? This stuff is so good. The opening is absolutely candy like, even in Donna’s version of green stravaganza. Instant burst of that bright bergamot with that creamy coffee underneath it. And at the peak of the dry down, it comes together with an earthy twist to it all with the vetiver coming out to complete the scent. The lack of performance is the only thing that should be docked on this fragrance, because as the scent begins to fade (after three hours or so, which I personally don’t mind) the vetiver becomes the top note and it begins to fade away the bergamot and coffee. Nonetheless, I still think this flanker is amazing and the most creatively balanced in the line. all of BIR is really creative, but overwhelmingly sweet. I look forward to a reformulation of green stravaganza in hopes that they increase the performance and strengthen that opening dna I love so much."

It's a matter of personal opinion at the end of the day and part of me wishes this one gets even more hate so it stays hidden because it's awesome.It's powdery sweet, just like BiR Intense, and has that coffee note instead of lavender. In the air it smells godly, also like BiR Intense.This is nothing like Ferragamo Signature. It has no leather note which I like actually.Between BiR Intense and this, this is more masculine for sure. I do love both though.The performance unfortunately is not the best. After 4-5 hours it's gone. It doesn't even stay on clothes for half a day.The bottle is sexy and feels high quality. The atomizer and cap could be better but are still very good.73 euros for a 100ml bottle is a touch on the expensive side. If it was 60-65 it would've been perfect.9.2/10 Hot"

It’s kind of the same story as montale. Their cheap, original, and good. I would say montale is better though but I still appreciate Valentino as there a designer but still good. Firstly I love the smell of this, it’s very fresh, green and natural which i appreciate because not many designer brands are doing that and sticking to a vanilla smell. The only down side is the performance which is just average and the only reason I’m saying that is because when comparing to montale is weak but that’s kind of an unfair comparison since montale is niche. In conclusion love this fragrance and what is represents as a original and new ideas with a good smell and average performance.Longevity 7/10*Silliage 7/10The scent 8/10Originality 8/10*Based of reviews"

Some might say the coffee note is a bit random but I honestly think it suits it. Tiny bit synthetic for me in the opening but it's still nice to wear. Decent projection and sillage with good longevity. My only complaint is that I don't get as much citrus as I would prefer; the coffee is very prevalent in this.

Longevity and projection is still EDT standard but it makes it perfect for a quick outing. Whether you're at the zoo, or the museum, the library, or the store, it works. A very unique scent that you have to really let it sit and get to you. At first it was very very basic to me. Reminded me of what Coach Green was trying to do but as time went on and I kept using it, I notice the sweet sticky coffee scent mixed with a fresh bergamont that just works.Definitely will be classed as an Underdog fragrance in a few years."

The dry down also smells incredible for its price value as the vetiver notes make this more masculine and in my opinion, projects an intellectual person scent.Since this fragrance is an EDT it doesn't have a strong longevity and lasts for around 4-6 hours which makes it good for short-term uses like going to the gym or going to a cafe but if you are going out for a full day then I wouldn't wear this.

This is the best flanker of them all. Really well blended. I don't get that much coffee. So to me it smells absolutely nothing like Halloween Man X.

Don't listen to those fragrance tiktokers that say buy Coral Fantasy and don't buy Green Stravagansa, because this fragrance is very very underated.Smell: A surprisingly good, fresh, green grass type scent that's hard to explain because it's very complex and sophisticated in my opinion.

I don't really get the coffee smell that everyone is talking about however. 8/10Performance: Solid performance, lasts decently long on skin and has solid projection.

I feel like it’s pretty unisex and women could definitely pull this off. Haven’t seen anyone else say this, but the dry down definitely reminds me of La Fin du Monde by Etat Libre d’Orange.

The main similarity between BIRG and MYSLF are they both have a light and airy composition and have similar longevity and performance.However, their dry downs are different. MYSLF has a blue, shower gel, fresh, soapy, fizzy dry down. Whereas, BIRGS dry down has a light-green, (herbal), slightly sweet, and earthy/vetiver that’s aromatic and fresh scent. The coffee note in BIRGS isn’t prominent but is slightly detectable in the dry down and works well with the fragrance’s earthy and aromatic dry down. Keep in mind that BIRGS isn’t a “coffee” forward fragrance! Also, the dry down may have a slight resemblance to BIRYD to some people.BIRGS likely doesn’t have the composition to perform well in cold weather; and is best suited for spring and summer weather whereas it really seems to blossom in heat. The smell that projects into the air is quite stunning and mass appealing; and will likely appeal to men 25 and older. Get your nose on this fragrance!Overall: 8/10 🔥💯"

A coffee scent with actual projection and longevity. Similar in terms of being an inoffensive coffee fragrance and also smells close but this one is more male instead of unisex because it misses the creaminess and is fresh. If it were a bit creamier I'd say this is the best designer coffee scents out there right now. A fresh and woody fragrance with an addictive coffee twist, one of the best in the valentino uomo line in my opinion. Keep in mind the coffee is mild and can be easy to miss for some people but let it settle. Can be worn all season. Will stand out in both warm and cold weather."

I can only really kinda get the resemblance to MYSELF with it being a everyday fragrance. I am a huge fan of MYSELF however and I am also a huge fan of this new flanker in the BIR line. The coffee note isn't super prominant but is still definitely there and is mixed very smoothly with the sweet citris of the bergamont. I also pick up from fruity notes that arn't listed in the note break down such as green apple. The opening is crazy good however the drydown isn't all that. It is a mix of coffee and vetiver which doesn't smell bad at all it just not as good as the opening. The only problem I have with this fragrance is that I go nose blind to it extremely fast, like I can even smell it on my skin after about 15 mins however I do know that it still there because I will sometimes get faint wiffs of it through out the day and even strangers will tell me how great I smell even when I think the fragrance wore off 2 hours ago. this is quite the room filler and I just wish I could pick up this beautiful scent on my skin at all times.2nd favorite in BIR line with coral fantasy being my favorite only because I can actually detect it on my skin. If that wasn't a problem it would be my favorite and a 10/10 for me. but over all 8.5/10 definitely worth trying out and don't let these idiots on fragrantica who poop on this fragrance for being to ""boring"" turn you away."

Not a strong performer, not a strong coffee scent either. It’s in there, but it’s a background note to my nose. I mostly just get a bit of bergamot and then just light vetiver. Again, it smells ok, but it’s honestly a pretty big let down after Uomo Intense and Rockstud. Those both had clear, cohesive scent profiles that lasted a solid 7-8 hours.I’m going to give this some more wear and see if I come around to it. This has been my experience with this entire line: I don’t like them at first, and then I love them. I will say this, it’s nice that Valentino isn’t following the designer pricing trend of late. This is “only” $125, compared to $155 for MYSLF or K EDP Intense or BB Cobalt Elixir or Burberry Hero…"

Bright, inviting, feel-good freshness, it's uncomplicated, some might say overly simple yet doesn't smell cheap (which it certainly isn't of course), I don't have performance issues considering the type of scent, even if I have other warm weather scents which last longer (CK2 for example, but that's a rare gem).I'd get a full bottle of this if I saw it going for a good price, would be a decent replacement for my Legend Spirit which is now empty, similar uplifting and mass pleasing vibe."

When I first unleashed it into the air, it was like releasing a genie from a bottle – except this genie smelled a little sweet and a little fresh. Think less Aladdin's lamp and sweet lavender-scented breeze with a dash of sweet modern anise. The drydown kinda reminds me of YSL La Nuit De L’Homme.Before unleashing it on myself, I decided to use my son as a guinea pig. Five sprays later (two on the shoulders, one on the back, one on the neck, and one on the abdomen), I watched him disappear into the mist like a freshly-baked pie cooling on a windowsill. But alas, the scent projection was as low as my expectations for the next season of my favorite TV show.As for longevity, well, let's just say it lasted longer than my last attempt at a DIY haircut. But seriously, about six hours before it faded into the fragrance abyss.So, what's the vibe with this perfume? Picture someone who enjoys fresh and sweet scents but prefers to keep things low-key, like a ninja sneaking up on a slice of cake. It's more about smelling clean than making a grand entrance. Sure, it lacks a bit of character, but hey, who needs character when you smell like a freshly laundered cloud?In conclusion, this perfume may not be a showstopper, but it's definitely not a snoozer either. Just think of it as your trusty sidekick in the quest for smelling good without trying too hard."

I *love* coffee as a note, so I sprayed it on and went to smell it and...it's another Invictus-derivative thing. Invictus/Jimmy Choo Man/Stronger With You/Azzaro Wanted/Herrera Bad Boy/JPG Scandal (plus other lines I'm sure I just haven't smelled). They all push that same amberwood sweetness. This is in line with that. There is a BRIEF green-grassy thing with some bitterness that you might call coffee for a few minutes after initial spray. After that you're just left with that base common to those scents I mentioned and essentially the smell of every mall/Sephora since 2015 or so.Longevity was pretty bad around 3-5 hours with little projection after the first 30 minutes. I didn't mind this, as I didn't like the scent.Overall a 6.0/10. It's not garbage but it's so derivative and void of creativity that I have no need for it. If you're 15-25 years old and want to smell sweet and like Invictus, but not actually Invictus, and can get this for ~50-75% off or something on a discounter, sure. For $125 I'd rather buy any number of Dior/Chanel or lower priced niche."

Coffee is the main player here to my nose. Similar vibe to yellow dream with a prominent coffee note added. I get major Replica; coffee break vibes soon as it hits the mid.

There's some clean musk too.Maybe some very faint tropical notes drifting throughout?The smell reminded me of a men's hair clay I used to wear as an adolescent. I think it was Garnier Fructis - Surf Hair - Matte Gum. Not sure if it's still around but it was sold in the early noughties.Saw that coffee is a listed note but it's not really strong if it is there at all. I wouldn't consider this a coffee based fragrance. I'm not really a fan of the line and am beginning to question the seriousness of the note breakdowns?I think this would suit a younger guy, 15 - 25.

Nice simple good smelling dry down as well. Good everyday fragrance inoffensive can be worn for all occasions I like the opening similar vein to YSL MYSLF and luna rossa ocean with a nice smelling dry down.

I don't know about the longevity of this one since I just tried it at Macy's but definitely not a basic smell.If you don't like the fragrances that just smell like citrus and alcohol, this is for you, belongs in the born in roma line."

That Calabrian bergamot does not sit well AT ALL with the coffee;- the combination worsens as it dries because that coffee is spilled over vetiver and it doesn't actually blend properly. Synthetic green coffee is a description which, in my opinion, works best for this piece. Very poor performance, on my skin it barely lasted, and while it did, it just smelled like A Drop d'Issey Essentielle mixed with the original Valentino Uomo and possibly a bit of TF Grey Vetiver (here and there, not everywhere). 4/10, this wasn't at all what I expected. I'll stick to my Born in Roma Yellow Dream."

Starts a bit mashed up, like it can't decide whether it wants to be sour or sweet. After a while (15 mins cca), the coffee note shows up, and it's a green coffee note reminiscent of Angel Schlesser's Essential for Men - it's the highlight of this perfume which lasts about 30 mins. After that, it turns unpleasantly sour once again, before finishing on a standard soapy, shower gel vibe shared by for example Rockstud Noir from this line, or Y from YSL. My expectations are met since this whole Born in Roma line is just bad."

The aromatic sweetness of the fragrance definitely helps the coffee stand out, otherwise it’d be no where to be found. It’s a pleasant smell for the first 20 minutes but slowly dwindles down to a slightly less sweeter note to eventually a basic wood note.On its own, I would have to agree with many others and say it’s a little bit disappointing. Especially for a Valentino BUT one thing I realize is that you can layer this fragrance with a lot of other ones to make it stand out and I think that’s where the star shines the most.If you’re looking for a new designer green fragrance, this one isn’t for you. I would sample this one first because it’s not a safe blind buy. If you’re collecting, this one is a no brainer of course it’s a lovely bottle and the green is great. Overall I’m giving the fragrance itself a 5/10. Docking points for longevity, projections, sillage, and overall uniqueness."

It’s just ok. Nothing groundbreaking or different. It doesn’t last very long or project much and I have no idea how coffee is supposed to be the prominent top note. Nice light Bergamot and a touch of vetiver and spice. Not very woody or earthy at all.If you have other Valentino Uomo fragrances, do not blind buy this even if they are your favourites. This is a flanker just to have a cool looking flanker. The green bottle/juice does look very cool, so there is that, I guess. If it was in a Nautica bottle it would be a great $19.99 buy and would sell like crazy. Almost $100/50ml for this is just nutty.Born in Roma Intense is 10x better for a few bucks more. I get that they are different and BiR Intense is a heavier cool weather fragrance, but if you want a lighter Valentino, buy the OG Born in Roma or Yellow Dream.I am a Valentino fanboy, but hard pass on this snoozer from me."

There's some clean musk too.Maybe some very faint tropical notes drifting throughout?The smell reminded me of a men's hair clay I used to wear as an adolescent. I think it was Garnier Fructis - Surf Hair - Matte Gum. Not sure if it's still around but it was sold in the early noughties.Saw that coffee is a listed note but it's not really strong if it is there at all. I wouldn't consider this a coffee based fragrance. I'm not really a fan of the line and am beginning to question the seriousness of the note breakdowns?I think this would suit a younger guy, 15 - 25.

Very vanilla forward, very sweet and spicy. I don’t get the coconut here much. And I really do not understand the Le Beau comparisons, they smell nothing a like.I think this is a good day time fall and winter fragrance. It’s too sweet and heavy for the high heat in my opinion.Definitely not a high heat tropical fragrance.

It’s extremely long-lasting and even survives through a shower. This fragrance will definitely get you plenty of compliments, but be aware that it’s so synthetic that you might end up hating it or getting a headache. That said, it’s very good for attracting compliments, and the projection is pretty impressive. Just don’t buy this for summer!

This Asad is a light perfume unlike the other Asad. It lasts quite a long time though and in the dry down, the coconut wafts more. Suits Summer time.. Zanzibar is nice and the silage is smooth. It's a grower.*Update* basically, on me, it's a mild vanilla and white musk. Pleasant and simple."

Buy it if you want to smell more synthetic then ever I don’t even know what lattafa was doing or were they were going with this

All in all, it's aimless...One more thing... it's long-lasting and projects well, I was able to smell it clearly after 4 hours + a shower 👍 so yeah... if you like it get it, the performance is decent."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"@Perfumist007 This was my first review on this forum, But I have a very good and tried and tested nose. I'm 62 years old and since I was 15 I've been using, smelling and researching the best perfumes out there. I generally only use niche perfumes that are not IFRA compliant. For me Rogue perfumery by Manual Cross is one that stands out! So you can say that I have seen all the designer perfumes (Chanel, YSL, Estee Lauder, etc, etc,) that once made good perfumes in the 70s, 80s, all have transformed into unrecognizable, diluted or chemical imitations. Except for a very few. No one can change my mind, because it is unfortunately so. So I have a baseline or reference if you like. Do not feel sorry for me, because my nose works well and is able to filter out chemicals. I did give Asad Zanzibar a second chance after a week. Still the smell is undefined, nauseating, and predominantly synthetic. But I am for sure , this comes with the price tag. It is a cheapy around 20-25 Euro's, and is smells like a cheapy. For me personally, I don't recognize anything in this fragrance in relation to the enthusiastic and positive reviews."

So, you made an account on fragrantica just so you can crap on it? I feel sorry for you. I really do.Everyone is different and fragrance is a very subjective topic. I actually got this a while back. When I first smelled it, I thought it was just a meh 😕 but it grew on me.Fast forward a couple of months now that it has settled a little bit (which is very common in fragrances, especially lattafa or middle eastern fragrance houses). You need to let them macerate at least a few weeks in order to have a more full experience of the juice.To me, this fragrance is not too sweet. Actually on my skin it has more of a salty element rounded by a hint of vanillic sweetness. I don't get any type of fresh notes. It starts off salty-sweet with herbaceous undertones. The mid (heart) leans powdery floral and that coconut vibe pops a little more as the fragrance starts to settle on my skin and then the drydown becomes a soft spicy, slightly smoky coconut vanilla. The saltiness lingers in a good way. It is definitely not your average perfume, but tbh? I don't smell anything off-putting. Is it synthetic? Probably. Do I sneeze when I smell it? No, I have smelled fragrances so synthetic that gave me a stuffy nose afterwards (from well known expensive brands)😅"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I’m a woman who loves wearing this. It starts off with those peppery and lavender notes, which is interesting and unique to me. Then after an hour or two, it changes its mind and says “Nope! I wanna be a spicy aquatic scent now.” Then after a couple more hours, it changes it mind one last time and decides to be this warm ambery vanilla. It’s a wonderful adventure.I did a blind buy with Asad Zanzibar. I was nervous because of the listed lavender note. I had tried YSL Libre before, and I think it was the lavender in it that absolutely killed any chance of me liking it. For me, it was awful. In Zanzibar, the lavender is so well balanced by the other notes that I don’t get the same headache-y effect as with Libre. I’m so glad I got it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I love it absolutely.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Like alot of people will say, initially I didn't like this at all. The opening is basically a harsh salty coconut water (that's all I could smell right away) it's unique and different compared to anything out there. The mid and dry down phases are better thankfully.A powdery, heavy lipstick iris combined with a gourmand like vanilla scent which eventually leaves a pleasant trail. It has decent longevity but you do initially suffer during that opening. I own a few lataffa scents and this is definitely the biggest one with so many different opinions. As many will dislike this as will like.The original Black Asad is a safer blind buy purchase. Probably only collectors of fragrances should be looking at this version. I would never recommend this to the average person who just wants a hidden cheapie summer gem to smell nice."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,To me this fragrance is really good.The opening is kinda bad right off the bat but leave it 5 minutes the magic starts to appear dry down is heavenly lobgevity is great about 9-10 hours price is really great too got it for 30$ i mean really good longevity really good scent profile sillage is moderate not beast but its okay and although it is a summer fragrance only the opening guides you to that summer fragrance but on dry down it is more of a fall and winter fragrance overall 910
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Got this a few weeks ago, I was expecting something very coconut forward, but this is exactly what the note says, it’s coconut WATER, not coconut itself. Smells exactly like coconut water, with a little creaminess from the iris and a little bite from the pepper. Although it wasn’t what I expected, it’s not a bad fragrance for the price, I’ve already worn it a few times in the past few weeks, decent longevity and projection, my wife told me she enjoyed it."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I don't get why people say it's the most synthetic thing they've ever smelled, I bet if this was bottled in a niche brand and priced over 300 dollars then they would say it's the best thing out there.This opens up with a really creamy coconut with notable iris and powder, not synthetic at all to me. After like 2 months, spices smell a bit more, which makes it more rich and complex, but the coconut and iris dominate almost the entire duration. Projects nicely for around an hour and then becomes a small bubble, but not entirely skin-scent, and stays like that for like 3-4 more hours until it's faint or gone, at least on me.Because of people opinions, I'd say it's not a safe blind buy, but this definitely smells really good and unique, not that mature either."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Another one I don't really get the hate for, so this to my nose is predominantly coconut, iris, and vanilla, the sea salt is in the background to give it some texture along with the lavender and pepper. The scent profile to me is very designer like in terms of quality and scent profile. Imo its like a givenchy gentlemen meets invictus victory with a salty twist to give a general idea of how it smells. I think it's a really nice coconut iris scent. Im not the biggest fan of salty notes so its not necessarily my favorite but i do think objectively its a good frag"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Got this on release and hated it. I had given it a really harsh review and gave it to my brother but not going to lie after it macerated which I'm noticing you must do with lattafa fragrances this thing shines. I regret giving it away but at least I can use it if I want to. This fragrance is loud and creamy and will fill an entire room. Give it some time. I still believe this is more suited for winter and not summer.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"First impression, will edit later:It is an interesting fragrance. In one way it is exactly how people describe it: Vanilla + coconut + salty fresh scent. But in another way its not what you expect when they tell you those notes.Overall i really liked it, the coconut and freshness makes it wearable on summer, but the sweet part makes it wearable on colder climate. I'd say its good for fall, spring and summer. Probably the best time would be spring, where it is hot but you still have cooler afternoons.In some ways it reminds me to Le Beau Le Parfum, however, this one is softer, less sweet and a little bit more fresh. However it is not like Le Beau EDT, as this one is more salty. It also has some added soft iris maybe closer to the Gentleman EDP line. Even if it is not declared, i believe there is some fig in there too. There is also a certain creamy vanilla that reminds me of Prada Luna Rossa Black.I haven't given it much use yet, however it projects fine at the start at least. I imagine this easily lasting over 8h.I don't get the hate it gets, it is very nice. I also don't think it is the most amazing fragrance ever as some people make it seem, but i'd say easily 8.5-9/10. I'd take this over Le Beau Le Parfum anyday. If you like Coconut and Iris this is a safe blind buy. And now that hype has dropped and you can find it at around $30, go ahead."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This was so unexpectedly good; imagine ripened coconut flesh mixed sea salt and a rather oily vanilla. Wavers between salty fresh and thickly sweet as it dries down, never quite settles between one or the other. There's a hint of something peppery and smoky in the backdrop, I assume it's the incense note.Projects very strongly off my skin, I was told I left a trail (test spray on inner elbow and wrist).This could work all year round, including winter during the daytime. The intensity is best suited towards spring & autumn, maybe summer nights.A unique standalone, I don't think it needed to be tied to the 'Asad' line."

The opening and dry down are kinda good, but while its drying down it reeks kinda like a stale damp ass wipe. Longevity and performance arent anything special imo.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Imagine if they try to dupe Paco Rabanne's Invictus Victory Elixir and they failed, BUT they came up with this and they eventually thought it is an unique scent and released it.This is a divisive scent!I would not say this is a summer scent just because it has coconut water note in it.It is bit spicy , vanilic and incensei at the final dry down and sweet at the end.This has 3 stages weirdly.1st. It is opens up with the pepperi and fresh spicy way from the lavender.To getting to the 2nd stage the coconut water start to coming up as well.2nd. This is when the scent a get a bit weird. Turns a little bit rubbery from the middle and the base note.3nd After around 2 hours later the rubberines is fade away and we are reach the vanilla and incense a bit creamy by the coconut water and stay a little bit spicy from the top. BUT stay in this creamy vanilic scent after all.NOT a fresh scent after all.Has some similarities with Bade'e Al Oud Honor & Glory Lattafa ."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Just got this fragrance, unmacerated it already is a bomb, super strong sillage and projection, longevity seems to be good also. I like the scent but I simply cannot place a situation where I would wanna smell like a coconut sunscreen lotion. My first impressions were that is a nice tonka bean smell similar to Scandal Le Parfum by JPG with an added waxy iris, with a very linear development. This is a weird fragrance to me, it simply is very unique but idk if it is mass appealing, or what it's purpose is at all. I wouldn't want to wear this other than to a date, too screechy for work/office, maybe it could work as a nice summer night night out fragrance, but this is not formal at all, if you want coconut vibes that will work for a lot of situations go for Le Beau LP."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I don’t understand the dislikes. This fragrance is very good, very different. Fine if people don’t like it, the more unique I will smell. The opening is a creamy coconut with vanilla and something that smells like musk to me, and others describe like salt (but I don’t know how salt smells). The opening may be the most challenging to some, but it becomes very pleasant after you give the opportunity to grow on you. The drydown evolves towards vanilla and incense, and it is excellent. Some coconut remains but it becomes subtle. The drydown shares some similarities, while remaining different, with the common vanilla heavy designer fragrances. It lasts few hours and at the end I mostly smell the vanilla. Several hour later it gave me the vibe of Tom Ford Noir Extreme, which is surprising because TFNE does not last that long. The variability with time is an excellent trip. Again, be patient and let it grow on you."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Bought this ~3 months ago & it smelled gross and plastic like. Made me gag & gave me a headache. Sprayed it today while choosing which fragrances to bring on vacation & now it smells pretty good to me. Complete 180 from what I thought before.I find it as one of the best tropical summer fragrances at this price point. Id recommend letting it sit for a while before making a final judgement. Last around 7 to 8 hours.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Personal opinion: One of The best fragrances at this price point. Creamy vanilla centric fragrance with a touch of spice. If you want to smell simply lovely get this very safe blind buy and practically a gourmand 10/10 fragrance for the price
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"First impression was okay, smells good. When you start to smell it more and more it gets better and better this one isn’t very complex but it’s a unique combination of notes. The pepper definitely comes off the top. I see where the hate comes from but I think you may have to go back and try it again. Spray it in the air not on a test strip. This thing shines in its silage. Up close it’s very peppery very vanilla very iris make up waxy smelling very synthetic. This is one of those that smells better to others then it does to you. To you it may be over powering but to the person you walk past that smells you that scent trail is smelling real nice. This is just first impressions but I’ll test it this week and report back."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I received a decanter and I've been wearing it for a few days now.The first day, I hated it.The second day, wore it to the gym. I didn't like the opening but the dry down was nice.This is something very unique, the opening is disconcerting to say the least. It's like the smell of rotten vegetation, pepper and the balsamic notes. The coconut note some talk about is nowhere to be found. That balsamic note persists for about two hours, and then it turns into a soft powdery vanilla with some tropical hints.IMO, it doesn't deserve a fraction of the hype that it has been getting, but it's not horrible either. You've got to have a open mind when you try it because the opening is very polarizing. Zanzibar has been growing on me, but not yet to the point where I would spend money on a full bottle. Compliments: not a single one in 3 days of wearing it, but I'll keep trying. To me this is a 6.5/10 , a decent fragrance."

It’s could be described as a summer day at the beach with the salty ocean in the air and in your hand you have piña colada. Lavender gives it a round feeling but the pepper give it the hint of manliness. Would say this is more manly than unisex but no fragrance is bounded to anyone.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Ordered a sample before I buy a new scent for the summer and man I was disappointed. The opening sold me and I was sure I was going to buy a 100 ml within the hour, but after about 5-10 minutes of a nice fresh iris, coconut and watery smell it went to a kind of dry vanilla and black pepper. The pepper is nauseating and I completely changed my mind after about 30 min. I gave it another try today and nope."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I certainly don't regret buying Asad Zanzibar, since it only cost like $25 from Amazon, but I also don't really find myself really enjoying the fragrance. It does have a sweet, tropical scent, and some coconut too, but I just like Jean Paul Gaultier Le Beau Paradise Garden a lot more, so I've been using that and just leaving Asad Zanzibar at home on the shelf. It's okay. Every fragrance isn't going to be everyone's favorite."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"this is amazing. when i first got it, i smelled it and i didnt know what to think, i hadnt expected it to smell the way it does and i didnt love it at first. Now, i cant get enough of it. It's really sweet, fruity and floral, it has a coconut smell mixed with vanilla and iris, it reminds me of le beau EDT. The performance is also really good, lasts for 7-8 hours on skin and on clothes for days. Also big compliment getter, especially with women (in my experience at least), one of my most complimented fragrances. Huge banger from Lattafa."

This fragrance is perfect for the summer season, opening has kind of a coconut water, iris and lavender smell, but the middle isn't that good. The incense smells like some kind of rubber or plastic, but then it dries down to a creamy vanilla sea breeze paradise. I really do love it anyway, so I'm giving this one a 9.99/10 (-0.01 for the middle)"

(If you can handle that atrocious middle.)8/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I personally do not like it. It’s not a summer scent because it is too much incense and that is overwhelming

The notes sound so good but unfortunately it’s blended terribly. Performance was decent for a freshy but other than that …. 2/10"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"OK initial reaction. I do not like the opening at all. Synthetic suntan lotion mixed with liquefied rubber and a dash of vanilla bean ice cream.As it starts to get into the mid it's much nicer, that weird rubber / Vinyl thing goes away. Becomes coconut, vanilla and iris. Oddly creamy and yet powdery at the same time.Overall, if you drop the harsh synthetic opening its not bad. Side story, I am a huge MI fan and I got milestone once to see if I needed to spend MI money. At first I hard a harsh kerosene smell off the top. After the bottle sat for a month or so, that was gone, and it's a decent MI cheapie. I still bought the MI because milestone to me was missing the sea notes.At any rate I say all that to say this. I'm going to let it sit for a few weeks and see. It's still nice once I get past the opening though.RN...Scent is 6.5/10... longevity is 10/10... Projection 8.5/10Also, this can easily be worn all year. The vanilla should do fine in colder weather."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Smells extremely similar to Penhaligon's Omniscient Mr Thompson, barely any coconut and no salty notes on my skin. If you like vanilla and iris you will like this."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This fragrance should be getting just as much love as its counterpart even if they are completely different. I feel like the low reviews are because you know what you are getting when you buy Asad, which is a clone. This is definitely a more of a stand alone scent.If I had to try and sum it up concisely I would say Zanzibar is a dark, salty summer coconut scent with great sillage/longevity for the price point. It will always have a spot in my summer rotation."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This isn't a clone of anything. It's not similar to le beau or 40 knots. It's a pretty unique scent profile, one that I haven't smelt. This is pretty good and unique. Iris is my favorite note in any fragrance, and I need more iris fragrances, so this was a good buy since it has a nice iris note in it. In my opinion the only and the biggest flaw of this fragrance is that it was marketed as the uber summer fragrance. It is definitely summer-y in a way because of the lavender, fresh blackpepper, coconut water and almost marine like salt note, however some sort of fruit, like a nice juicy bergamot or something could have elevated the fragrance so much more. It is not as refreshing as other summer frags. Summer fragrances aren't my cup of tea, but I appreciate the good ones though. This is something I would definitely rock in the summer, but for the vast majority of people it would be a too cloying or simply not as fresh as other summer fragrances. I would have loved a good bergamot and pineapple combo in this fragrance. It's weird since the name Zanzibar would suggest something tropical, yet this fragrance lacks on that department other than the coconut water, but even the coconut water isn't really too prominent. Wasted potential."

This fragrance is a blast of coconut and vanilla.Performance:The projection is excellent—noticeable without being overpowering. Just a few sprays last the entire day, and on clothes, it can linger for days.Overall Impression:If you love sweet, long-lasting fragrances, this cologne is a fantastic choice. It's a perfect alternative to JPG Le Beau, delivering impressive longevity and a delightful scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This a creamy, sweet, coconut and iris dominant fragrance. It is less fresh than I was expecting and I imagine could be quite cloying if over-sprayed. The iris reminds me of the Givenchy Gentleman Society DNA although I find this fragrance to be widely unique. It borders on gourmand with a slight tropical sunscreen vibe and I personally would reach for it much more than the original Asad. I heard a content creator on TikTok say that Zanzibar smells of a nice oatmeal, and I have to agree with its creamy gourmand quality.Another successful blind buy that has impressed me."

For some reason I get note of urine in this fragrance. Given this is my first fragrance with iris in it, I feel that note is to blame. While you get the nice sun tan lotion coconut along with the pepper, I can't get over the urine smell."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,kind of sour slight coconut incense at first but dry down is nice vanilla.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The hate on this one is unjustified. It smells great, it lasts long and performs great.For example I sprayed twice on my shirt and 24 hours later I am still getting persistent whiffs of it.I was expecting something not so great based on the reviews here, but a good deal popped up and I bought it.It smells high-quality to me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I found this one very interesting. It opens up a bit overly sweet, but that’s tamed within 5 minutes and to me, that’s when this fragrance shines. The coconut water combined with the iris and lavender make this a unique take on a warm weather/ tropical fragrance.I’ll be honest, the first time I wore it, it was so different than what I expected I wasn’t sure I liked it. However after the 2nd full wear I really fell for it. Picture the same iris vibe as Dior Homme, with a soapiness from the lavender, and a lingering, yet slight coconut scent in the background. As it dries the addition of the vanilla and incense give it nice longevity.If you’re expecting a straight up tropical vibe, this one isn’t it, but if want something just a little different for the warm weather. Check it out. The price point is worth grabbing a bottle.Oh and because it does wear a bit dense this could be worn all year but I prefer it in warm weather."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"So i finally got this fragrance and it smells nice. Is it a game changer like the reviews suggest, i dont think so. Smells very nice dont get me wrong however is did not meet my expectations based on the hype and reviews. Maybe once it matures it will get better. The performance is also nothing to write about on both skin and clothes. Ill give it a month and see if my opinion changes. Cocunut, vanilla is what i get. No incense or any of the extra things people talk about.Update: 2 months later and i still think its okay, average smelling and not a game changer. However i get a lots of compliments on this thing. I dont really understand what is it that people are going crazy but people love it. I can easily say that this has been my highest compliment getter that i can think off and i have over 110 fragrances."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I normally love iris, vanilla, and coconut, but this was shockingly unpleasant. I don't have any bias against clones for the record. I own quite a few, including the original Asad. I just genuinely hate this one. The hype train seemed manufactured and I'm quite glad I waited to test in person. It smells like a plastic makeup bag on fire."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I'm not too sure about this one. For me it started off really heavy on the coconut and lavender, but the iris gave it a distinct sour milk note that I didn't find appealing at all. Pretty accurate I suppose because coconut water is slightly sour, but as a smell I would have preferred a sweeter note.2 hours later it's a powdered vanilla and incense bomb, almost identical to the normal Asad.Strong sillage and longevity, but no idea where or when you would wear such a scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Confusing feeling like you got out the water at the beach! This is a sunscreen and sand smell (which I love), however, I'm not sure the powdery effect is my favorite. I was looking for something with coconut though, as Qaed Al Fursan Unlimited just came out different than I expected (I had a cold when it was sprayed on me).This one definitely has some masculine elements. I love the vanilla smell in the drydown. It's a vanilla note similar to the Victory Elixir vanilla / tonka. Basically a tonka-vanilla. It's a little bit of a blue scent to me, but it alternates. Crisp fruity in the opening, but can change to a coconut water or coconut smell depending how hard you sniff it. Or sometimes it smells like the beach breeze and sand. Then, powdery after a few hours, baby powder and lotion like. Then, the Victory Elixir-esque drydown.I'm using it as a summer scent. I'm happy, if not raving, for the price paid it's another contender for the collection! If you don't expect much, this is a good change of pace from woody or heavier winter scents."

It opens up with coconut and then it mjxes with powdery vanilla. Let me try to picture it to you. If you would take that coconut from OG le beau and mix it with that dusty vanilla bran note from the scent magnetic plus imcense from victory elixir... you will get this, freshened with lavander.This is by no means a clone or even close to either mentioned frags so forget that you will get it as a replacement or even a similar frag. No. This is completely a unique scent that borrows strongest aspects from those 3 frags. When you catch a whiff of it... sometimes you will think... hm, le beau. Other thimes... mmm what a nice vanilla, its a bit like victiry elixir. But then you smell it closely and you see that irs jot eituer of the 3 frags. That lactonic feel can come off as latex or leathery on some skin.This is sweet and not for summer sun. I found out that it does work in heat but when you are in the park, shade, forest where is a wind or a slight breeze. This would work by the sea in cooler summer nights perfectly. Beast mode longvity and projection. 8+ hours easily at worst. I could smell this on my arm the next day.Is it a safe frag? No. Bling buy worthy... no, unless its around 25-30 euros max. Try it first as there is a very good chsnce you will not like it."

It is a fresh, sweet coconut scent with hints of vanilla and iris!Why spend 70$+ on acqua di gio or light blue series when this exists. All these salty fragrances are so booring to the point they all smell the same! This one is better than le beau and will be in my rotation this summer!"

To me, this is a great summer fragrance that stays away from the 1000s of mainstream synthetic, marine, salty, or sweet summer fragrance that make everybody smell the same.This will make you stand out, in a good way. It might also need some sitting on the shelf for a while to mature as with other middle eastern fragrances to even probably get elevated to a masterpiece level. All in all, very glad I found me a new stable for my upcoming hot summer rotation."

The incense in Zanzibar is not too strong, but is enough to set space for the rest of the notes. It tries to be less a blue fragrance and more an elegant fragrance."

I can also get a little of the lavender in the beginning but it’s muted. Dry down after an hour or so is mostly a sweet vanilla coconut milk vibe.Decent projection and longevity for a cheap summer freshy, do wish the opening spicy lingered longer.To me this is a youthful scent if on a guy (maybe 40 and younger?) and leans slightly more masculine but is def unisex esp the sweet dry down."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is quite conflicting to my nose, i am not sure if in a good way or bad, I guess time will tell.Opening is the major gripe, as it might come across as a dairy product going spoilt. It tries to be too complicated with pulling the creaminess in all possible directions; especially the inclusion of smokey accord with saltiness, that doesn't sit too well with the rest of the structure. If you can manage to get past this opening clusterfuck then it becomes surprisingly very good! In the late middle - drydown this thing shines out quite handsomely and fits into that sweet-salty profile, which I had been searching for a long time, and is rather difficult to pull off without making the scent too feminine.Performance is only decent so far, nothing too great as it lasted on my skin for 5-6 hours with good projection in the first hour.I will keep this for maceration and hope things get better. Will update accordingly."

Its the kind of fragrance's DNA we're getting used to nowadays. A strong sweet fragrance based on vanilla and fruit. It projects nicely and performs just as good.But everything else is wrong. As the fragrance dries down, you can tell it doesn't smell good. In fact, feels too waxy and synthetic. The worst part is that it gets stuck in your head and so, you might start to hate it.I'm not easily impressed. When I see someone warning (or hating) on a fragrance I tend to ignore it.

That's right up my alley!!Review to follow after it arrives...(22APR24) Arrival day:[Thank you Amazon for Prime 2-day delivery!]Sprayed it on paper and got the waxy iris and some kind of vanilla in the background...nice, but I wasn't blown away. I let the paper sit while I ate dinner and watched youtube videos...smelling it every now and then. It pretty much stayed the same on paper...that dry waxy iris with some bright citrus and vanilla...very nice.Then I went to take a shower and get cleaned up, after doing the ""Triple-S"" I decided to try two sprays of ""Asad-Z"" on chest. Immediately got a creamy vanilla on skin as the scent wafted up to my nose/face. Then the bright Iris hit. I wasn't waxy like it smelled on paper!!Then I noticed how loud it was...two sprays of most other fragrances aren't this powerful. THAT is the kind of performance I like!! It is now 2 hours later and I'm still getting the same P-U-S-H from those two sprays to my chest. VERY NICE!!!It almost feels like as this develops, the iris takes a backseat to some kind of dry woodiness and a creaminess that takes over the fragrance.This is very....odd.It's sweet and creamy vanilla...with this dry woodiness in the background.I'm not getting any coconut or anything like it.This fragrance reminds me of ""Victoria Secret - Tease Creme Cloud""...just sweeter and with Iris in it.I'm going to give it a full-day wear to work tomorrow and then I'll give it a final rating.But so far...this is a winner!!23APR24:Welp, wearing this to work today with a layer of ""Burberry Goddess"" and it's WONDERFUL!!The sweetness of ""Goddess"", the Dry powderiness of ""Zanzibar""....awesome!I figured out why it reminds me of my ""VS - Tease Creme Cloud"", its got that ""Black Pepper"" that stays persistent in the fragrance aura. Its in the background...but its constantly there.Sillage trail on this one....MASSIVE!!I left a trail of Zanzibar from the entry of the security checkpoint all the way to the bus depot on the other side of the building. I could hear people coming into the security checkpoint saying how nice it smelled in the building, lol.Walking around, I can smell ""Zanzibar"" over the ""Goddess"" because of the dry-woodiness of ""Zanzibar"".I am still picking up on the sweet lavender of ""Goddess"", but everything else...ZANZIBAR!I'm still not getting any ""Coconut"" from this, just the Iris, Vanilla and Black Pepper.But you know what...that's just find with me.I'd once built a fragrance with Vanilla, Black Pepper and Cedar and loved it while I had it. I moved on and never went back to make another bottle...but this ""Zanzibar"" gives the same kinda feel and all I've gotta do is spray and enjoy.I think I'm going to enjoy this even more once it macerates and gets better in a month or so. I'll be wearing it at least once or twice a week though. I'm looking forward to seeing how my inner circle feel about it when I wear it around them all...26APR24:I don't know what happened, but the creaminess factor of this fragrance went into overdrive tonight. I smell like a vanilla ice cream cone....holy shinola!!!I need a backup bottle ASAP!! 😲😲😲❤️❤️❤️❤️03MAY24:This does not work in high heat.Disappears like a fart in a windstorm.Guess this will be a Fall/Winter frag...."

As for the scent, I do not think it is blindbuy safe. The notes may seem intriguing, but I would highly recommend to test it before purchasing. Call me crazy, but this fragrance reminds me of those fragrances from a different time period, such as Pour Un Homme de Caron, Boucheron Jaipur, etc. . . Maybe it is because of the vanilla, powder and lavender notes haha"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I do think it smells fine but just not for me. I get some lipsticky iris and powderiness vibes from Dior Homme Intense combined with some sweetness and creamyness from Le Beau.- not safe for blind buy- not a fully summer scent as it can be too cloying- pretty good vanilla drydown but too much for me- quite strong and lasts all day- unisex
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The fragrance is generally very tropical, which is probably due to theCoconut water note comes about. The creamy vanilla is also very pleasant in the drydown and harmonizes with the coconut. What I absolutely dislike, however, is the opening of the fragrance. The fragrance starts too salty for me in the first 2 hours and somehow not coordinated. However, it must also be said that it fades after these 2 hours and the fragrance gets back on its feet.Opening :An earthy/sweet coconut with too much salt, as well as pepper and incense nuancesDrydown : Creamy musky coconutShelf life : 10h (Depends on skin types)Sillage : 1:30” in the air and 10h close to the skinConclusion:For me personally, it smells absolutely nothing like Le Beau or Le Beau Paradise Garden.Opening not for everyone due to the excessive salt smell, but in any case a successful tropical fragrance but I still don't think it justifies the hype."

Its super lactonic, thick creamy & ULTRA sweet. Literally smells like melted vanilla ice cream. Am I missing something?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,coconut milk with a hint of freshness and musk. It's alright. Good for the price. incense is to much and overpowering. It is really unique. performance is normal. which is was more aquatic or tropical and they toned up the saltiness this would be so good.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I blind bought 2 bottles and was glad I did. It delivers on everything. If you like summery tropical JPG Le Beau type vibes, and with coconut that actually delivers instead of burning off immediately after application (like Le Beau), this is great juice, especially with the strong vanilla blast it also has. And don't be fooled if you think the performance isn't all that great - you're probably just getting noseblind. And on top of that, if you perspire at all, even 8 to 10 hours after spraying it on, it explodes back to life. So go easy on it if you're going to hit the gym with this stuff on. It can seriously go nuclear, so don't over-spray. You'll still smell it on your clothes a week later."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I have no idea what did Lattafa do to get people so dissatisfied and almost angry about how this scent smells. To me, it smells exactly as what the reviewers have described it. Salty-creamy-coconut-spicy-incense is what I get, in the dry down you get a pleasant creamy spicy incense. I kinda get what people mean about the sun lotion smell but thats almost like saying cough syrup tastes exactly like non-carbonated coke, it has similarities yea but you're just a hater with no objective opinions at that point. Great stuff, 8/10"

At first it was all Bad Boy and Scandal homme which I despise but a few hours later the most lovely vanilla and incense, Worth the 45 I paid as it's just launched, when it goes down to 25 like the original asad i'll stock up. Didn;t get any salt"

Nothing ground breaking, it just a fresh sweet tropical fragrance, alittle sunscreen, some coconut, abit of lavender...pretty safe.EDIT: Gave it a full wearing today. I get no iris at all, a roasted scent and something slightly plasticky, and a ton of sweet vanilla as well. It very vaguely reminds me of Le Beau EDT but then it just becomes its own thing. I'd give it a 8.7/10 just because I like the scent profile/I'm into sweet scents."

This shit smells like crap, I don't get it. Coconut water?? More like sewage water with hint of coconut. I mean, WTF? I really doubt Lattafa is paying them to promote this. Don't listen to anyone really, always check your fragrances before buying. Wasted 2 dollars on decant. 0/10"

What a disappointment, this is the first Lattafa that i'm truly disgusted by. I was very excited to check this out when it came out since i love Lattafa frags and i really like the OG Asad. And thank the heavens i decided to buy a decant first instead of blind buying this because it's straight up awful.On my skin i get this lactonic smell which turns very sour, like spoiled milk or spoiled baby formula, and the longer it dries down the worse it gets. Gag-reflex inducing and i'm not exaggerating. I can't imagine anybody wearing this in the heat of summer as it is advertised for.Hard pass, and the first Lattafa i'd give a bold 0/10."

I usually love Lattafa's offerings, but this is such a disappointment. The note break down and how essentially every fragrance influencer hyped this fragrance up, I thought we were in for a treat. This straight up smells like suntan/sunscreen lotion that has been mixed with coconut water and dumped into a fog machine/humidifier. It's not bad, but its not great either.Skip this and get something else you have on your wishlist."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,A decent Fragrance for $40. Personally I feel it’s a little too artificial. It does settle well.

I got sucked into some YouTube reviewers giving it high marks. It's probably the worst cologne I've smelled since Lattafa Wajood. I was expecting a creamy coconut vanilla fragrance.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"My first thought from smelling this is woah, this is not a unisex scent and woah, that first note is not vanilla! It opens with a very strong incense with a touch of vanilla. That pepper is there and proud and then dries down into an insencey warm iris. The coconut water becomes more prominent, and the iris is then pushing into the forefront. It's masculine, not masculine-leaning and strong and lasts forever. Get it if you're a guy and you like to make a statement. Just be warned, it's a very cold-weather heavy scent."

Very disappointed from hearing this was a fresh creamy coconut scent. Willing to trade if anyone wants too."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Glad I waited till after 3rd full wearing to write this review, bacause I would need to edit what I would wrote after first and 2nd wearing.First I want to say it looks like we have here fragrance that smells differently on paper and skin, and further different way on different people. On paper I smell a lot of pepper and iris, while on my skin iris becomes subtle and pepper is gone almost completely. More smoke but less salt on paper, and opposite on my skin. My female co-worker asked to test it, and on her skin it smells like 100% dupe of Xerjoff 40 Knots, only with less projection and sillage.On my skin it smells in between 40 Knots, JPG Le Beau and new Boss Bottled Pacific. Like if you would make triangle out of 3 mentioned, Zanzibar will be right in the middle of it.Now to performance. At first full wearing I was disappointed. It lasted about 4 hours and was a skin scent. Next day same 4 hours, but projection was moderate, I was getting occasional whiffs of it first 2 hours.3rd wearing was week later. I brought bottle with me to work with expectation of need to re-spraying it. All day I haven't received any compliments from my co-workers who oftem compliment me, or had complaints from one who always says I'm smell ""like a whole Sephora store"". In the end of the day we had to do some physical work and I broke in sweat a little bit. I received few back to back compliments, and sarcastic comment from one who always bitching ""Are you seriously just doused yourself in perfume in the middle of the work?"" ...It was about 8 hours since I applied 6 sprays in the morning heading to work.Conclusion: it needs time to macerate and heat or sweat to project.I'm not sure if hype around it warranteed, but it is pretty good fragrance. Not necessary replacement for 40 Knots, but if you don't have Xerjoff already it is definitely full bottle worthy. Maybe a must if you into this type of scents.Despite of already having bottles of 40 Knots and Le Beau, I have no regrets buying Zanzibar. Now I can scratch Bottled Pasific from my wish list because Zanzibar serves same purpose but has much better performance."

I smell nothing but saltiness and a bit of fruity scent but not adequately to make it smell good. I would give it 4 out of 10. and I hope it'll get better, as maceration is a must with this one.If you consider buying it don't"

Not a summer fragrance at all. This is for winter don't trust the retards reviewing this on tik tok, those guys have no idea what they be talking about."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Fairly Unique!After a week and a half of waiting since I ordered, this finally arrived in the mail. (f u giftexpress). The opening comes at you very strong with a very aromatic coconut creaminess that makes you think... ""I've smelt that before, but I don't know where"". The scent then quickly starts giving off a lot of that Iris which gives it a lot of powderiness (not even a word). I'd agree with what other comments and reviews say about the iris resembling the one from Dior Homme Intense (that is the only similitude to the fragrance) After about 2 hours the scent profile leans more into the lavender while still maintaining the faint coconut (which is not so creamy at this point. It's more of that Coconut Water that the note breakdown mentions). Projection is above average with a very good longevity that will be a good bang for your buck. I had my gf give me her opinion and she did not find it very pleasing. With her saying that it reminded her of sun screen aerosol, but I had other compliments from fellow classmates. You'll obviously have your fair share of haters, but it will not outnumber the people that like it. Overall a good job from Lattafa."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"What’s that brother, it smells like fruit rotting with a punch of repellent iris"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is not what I expected. There is nothing especially ""fresh"" or ""beachy"" about this. The first smell that hit me when I first sprayed was BENZOIN. Although not listed in the notes, the vanilla like, slightly medicinal, tinged by cinnamon, odor of benzoin is unmistakable. The benzoin is joined by a very natural, slightly powdery, lavender note. Then coconut emerges. It is not an ethereal coconut water note to my nose, more of a dense, matte, creamy, coconut pulp. The iris is there, but it does not smell like a carrot or bag of makeup like some iris notes. It merely enhances the overall creamy/ powdery quality of the fragrance. The salt note does not appear until the dry drown. Mixed with the ""vanilla"", which I suspect is benzoin heavy, and incense, it creates a quite sexy and sweet skin scent. I would consider this fragrance unisex, though leaning male, and appropriate for any season. I have smelled JPG Le Beau before, and it is nothing similar to this. Perhaps the Parfum is, although I've never smelled it. If anything, the benzoin/ vanilla combo here recalls another fragrance from the same house: Maison Alhambra Sceptre Oceana, although these fragrances are very different. In all, this fragrance is quite nice, but be prepared for a different interpretation of coconut. This is a mature deep, sexy, resinous, coconut for adults."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This one smells like Scandal Le Parfum or maybe a little bit like Le Beau le Parfum and Victory Elixir. It is a bit creamier with a heavier vanilla note and a bit spicier than all of those mentioned. It almost smells like it has cinnamon or something in it.

It’s a nice creamy coconut scent. People say it’s a clone of Le Beau Parfum, but I disagree.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Ok, Lattafa, Sterling, Afnan are trying to up the level and go after Amouage, The House of Oud and The Spirit of Dubai this is why they are using professional perfumers. They want a chance to be a household name not as a Cheap Cloner but a prestige brand. The Niche Clone houses are way better at this point the industry is moving very quickly and they want to move up."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This is a straight up Pina colada scent. If you like that type of perfume it easily fits that genre.Nicely done but not ground breaking or unique. And in my humble opinion not better than the OG. Although there is becoming a phenomena and hype over fruity type frags lately so this sits well with that.I own over 1000 fragrances and I can tell you Lattafa didn't need to hire a perfumer to make this one as its reminiscent to many they have in their other collections such as Badee Al Oud honor and Glory or the sublime flanker (without the moss). I also get Lattafa Ajayeb portrait vibes in this as well as the Lattafa Qaeed Al Fursan unlimited.It's not cloning them but fits into them scent DNA's perfectly.If you'd like smelling like a Pina colada then this will be your thing. I will however let this sit for a while and give it a full wearing (over sprayer style) and then see what vibes I get from it... For now this is my take on it.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I was glad to see lattafa think outside the box and hire master perfumer ""Fanny Bal"" to create a flanker for the long time hype beast ""Asad"". The fact they decided on an original scent was a bold move considering they had big shoes to fill! (In the world of cheap middle eastern frags that is.. 😆) I think they nailed it! If your not a fan of iris then you won't like it, but if you like iris like I do then your in for a treat! On my skin it's a very creamy iris and vanilla with some tropical salty coconut in the background. The good coconut that doesn't give off that cheap sun tan lotion smell which I think makes this a better more versatile fragrance. Just letting it sit for a couple days it's already becoming smoother so I can imagine like most middle eastern fragrances, if I let this mature a bit we definitely could have the next ""Asad"" hype beast! The first night I got it I sprayed my hand before bed and I could still smell it 8 hours later when I woke up... and that was fresh out of the box. With some maturation time, this could easily be a 10 hour fragrance. Projection and sillage are pretty good for the first couple hours. I give it a 9.5![Don't listen to the F*cking trolls in the comments or pay attention to the bad votes. Somehow it received some bad reviews the second it was released probably just to screw with the company or to try to kill the hype it already had. Either way it's a fantastic fragrance.]"

Packaging similar to Asad, the blue bottle is a nice touch although not my favorite design still. The atomizer is similar to Asad (which is great!) and you can control the spray to mist.The opening spray is a lavender spice that does need some time to form, which is expected from these scent profiles and once it dries down into the salty-irisy-coconut, it smells like SUMMER baby. Spring, Summer, day/night. Reminds me of the profiles of Le Beau EDP and similar mass appealing scents. The performance is similar to Asad, so skin chemistry may vary but expect 8 hours minimal! The vanilla and incense carries it through beautifully.I prefer this over alot of spring/summer freshies."

I'm a little thrown off by the opening, as there's a bit of a stale accord in the first five minutes, which I can only describe as old people-ish. Obviously these Middle Eastern fragrances are much better once they're macerated a bit, so hopefully that will take away some of the staleness from the opening."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Asad-Zanzibar-90713.html,Asad Zanzibar Lattafa Perfumes cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Nice scent, very different from the og. Lavender and salty iris with semi-sweet airy creamy vanilla is what I'm getting the most out of this. A pleasant smelling designer style sweet scent profile, so it's in the realm of fragrances like Le Male Le Parfum/Le Beau, Invictus Victory, and PR Phantom. It's a casual fun fragrance with moderate performance that doesn't smell particularly unique but mass appealing enough for most people to enjoy."

The smell you get from this is when you go to make your move and kiss her neck. The salty hair, the lotions and oils, the sexual pheromones.. kind of confusing to me for this to come across as masculine when that’s what it reminds me of. A salty sexy beach chick. Performance was ok, 4/5 hours. Maybe with time it will be better. Still a great scent."

When you store your cloths in a trunk or leave your cloths in some cabinet for a long period of time, then it generates a smell. Thats exactly Asad Zanzibar is.

This site is supposed to be informative and to enable people to find fragrances that are right for them. People are going to do no such thing if a fragrance has to make it through a few dozen bullsh*t votes at the start before any consensus about its pros and cons can even begin to energe. If you're fake-voting just because you arbitrarily want to troll Lattafa or this product, that's incredibly lame, short-sighted and selfish. If you're trolling the product because you're linked to one of Lattafa's competitors, that's probably worse. Know that you're undermining this whole site as a platform that people use to research unfamiliar fragrances, yours probably included. If you're trolling this fragrance because it comes from the UAE and you don't like, say, UAE's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict, that is in no way f***ing relevant to whether this is a fragrance that any of us might like and want to buy and wear, so go and protest at the embassy instead.

On paper I smell a lot of pepper and iris, while on my skin iris becomes subtle and pepper is gone almost completely. More smoke but less salt on paper, and opposite on my skin. My female co-worker asked to test it, and on her skin it smells like 100% dupe of Xerjoff 40 Knots, only with less projection and sillage.On my skin it smells in between 40 Knots, JPG Le Beau and new Boss Bottled Pacific. Like if you would make triangle out of 3 mentioned, Zanzibar will be right in the middle of it.Now to performance. At first full wearing I was disappointed. It lasted about 4 hours and was a skin scent. Next day same 4 hours, but projection was moderate, I was getting occasional whiffs of it first 2 hours.3rd wearing was week later. I brought bottle with me to work with expectation of need to re-spraying it. All day I haven't received any compliments from my co-workers who oftem compliment me, or had complaints from one who always says I'm smell ""like a whole Sephora store"". In the end of the day we had to do some physical work and I broke in sweat a little bit. I received few back to back compliments, and sarcastic comment from one who always bitching ""Are you seriously just doused yourself in perfume in the middle of the work?"" ...It was about 8 hours since I applied 6 sprays in the morning heading to work.Conclusion: it needs time to macerate and heat or sweat to project.I'm not sure if hype around it warranteed, but it is pretty good fragrance. Not necessary replacement for 40 Knots, but if you don't have Xerjoff already it is definitely full bottle worthy. Maybe a must if you into this type of scents.Despite of already having bottles of 40 Knots and Le Beau, I have no regrets buying Zanzibar. Now I can scratch Bottled Pasific from my wish list because Zanzibar serves same purpose but has much better performance."

And thank the heavens i decided to buy a decant first instead of blind buying this because it's straight up awful.On my skin i get this lactonic smell which turns very sour, like spoiled milk or spoiled baby formula, and the longer it dries down the worse it gets. Gag-reflex inducing and i'm not exaggerating. I can't imagine anybody wearing this in the heat of summer as it is advertised for.Hard pass, and the first Lattafa i'd give a bold 0/10."

If you're a grown man with a developed nose Invictus Parfum will likely be a no-go for you. As Invictus Parfum smells like all the other generic and sweet smelling designer fragrances flooding the market.Invictus Parfum's performance is surprisingly weak too, and subsides significantly after 2 hours and sits very close to the skin. 🧐🤨 Should you decide to purchase Invictus Parfum, do yourself a favor and do not pay retail for this fragrance. I personally don't think this flanker is worth $70.00 as it truly lacks any sort of thought and creativity. Rabanne really needs to rethink their strategy for the Invictus line, as the Invictus line seemed to have gone down hill after 2018."

I received Nitro Red earlier this week and tested Invictus Parfum today on skin for full wearing and on strip. They have very similar vibes and notes, but not identical to my nose.In the opening Nitro Red has that Watermelon fruity freshness to it while Invictus Parfum has the soapy fresh scent. In the dry down Nitro goes a bit warm and almost like cinnamon candy that has been stripped of the hot spice but retains the amber warmth. Invictus Parfum dries down with the soapy green freshness still present.Nitro performs slightly better but you could just spray more of Invictus Parfum to improve its projection and longevity.Both are good. If you cannot test them both first and are wanting to just blind buy, get Nitro Red if you want a fruitier then slightly warm profile, and Invictus Parfum if you want a soapier, more refined and mature profile."

It stays in that opening stage for a few hours before it finally begins to slowly mellow out into something that resembles Invictus Legend, but only slightly. There isn't much olfactory depth after that.I had high expectations, but this is just too pedal to the metal sickly sweet in the opening, it's almost like they took the sweetness from Phantom and ramped it up to 11, but forgot to actually mellow it down within the first few moments of the perfume's life on your skin.

If you're a fan of the whole line, just go with it. In the opening, this thing reminds me of Invictus Victory Elixir/Le Beau Le Parfum with that coconut note. After that, an Invictus Platinum-type of lavender appears in addition to the marine and soapy notes from the original Invictus. I really like it because I'm a fan of the whole line; however if you're not a fan of the line in general, you'll probably don't like this. I've come to learn that the Invictus line is polarizing.In this case I think Invictus Parfum is polarizing because of different skin chemistries, this is one of those fragrances that smell different from one person to another. Obviously, in my opinion this is not a blind buy, specifically due to those marine and soapy notes.In my particular case, I really like it because it's probably gonna be the last release of this line and that makes me nostalgic.The fragrance particularly is versatile and alluring.

It reminds me a lot of the current Trussardi Uomo then.I don't think performance is anything to write home about but only Legend does it for me, this one does a decent enough job so far, about the same as platinum, I'll probably edit once I spend more time using it."

I’d find that more questionable if this was a true “freshie,” but it’s not. This is primarily a spring/fall fragrance to me with some functionality during the summer.I will admit, this isn’t suuuper unique, I’ve definitely smelt something like this somewhere else. But don’t take that as “you’re gonna smell like everyone else,” because it’s still got something special about it.I’m currently wearing it for the first time, so I can’t talk much about performance, but I am getting whiffs off of my shirt 90 minutes after spraying, decent sillage so far…"

No doubt more for the general public (and collectors) than most fragrance aficionados who will probably already have similar fragrances in their collections (if they like this style that is).

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Invictus Parfum is an aromatic, marine and musky fragrance.Its opening is very similar to the original Invictus, it is sweet and aromatic with the smell of fruit gum. This phase is maintained for almost an hour and with good intensity. The marine notes of the original are also perceived, however here the salty accord has been removed, and a soapy accord has been added with a little lavender, until reaching a musky and slightly woody base.The first hour is very sweet, I thought it was going to be a fragrance oriented towards autumn, but over time the fragrance becomes marine and musky, giving it a feeling of more versatility, to be used practically all year round, with the exception of days of intense heat and can also be used in many situations, from school, to casual outings, etc.In terms of longevity, it has a very good duration of almost 10 hours. and remarkable sillage the first two hours.This Invictus Parfum version is more bold compared to the original Invictus, it is more intense in some aromatic accords, although it is still fresh and marine. In short, it is a modernization of the Invictus style that has been used so much in perfumery and will surely continue to be liked by many people."

For me - great for first 2-3 hour, then it's OK. You can reapply it of course. As said - it's a mix of Legend and first Invictus. Not a game changer but really good juice. For me 7/10."

Drying down to the Japanese inspired public baths in a western city where two older women sit across from each other draped in warm towels talking shit about their husbands. Wear this if you would like to save on your rent by moving into the small cupboards that hold linen in the local hotel, of course you would need to do this without anyone knowing (installing your own lock).

The lavender is present after spraying but fades quite quickly. Cashmeran brings warmth and softness, sandalwood a touch of sensuality; it's a ""comfortable"" and pleasant scent.It's very classic indeed, if you're looking for something out of the ordinary, you can go your way without regrets. But that doesn't mean that this Invictus Parfum smells bad. If you like simple scents, this will be perfect.I would describe it as a marine/woody scent because those are the notes I smell the most. Very soft and enveloping."

It's synthetic and screechy.So I didn't have high hopes for this but rest assured it is a massive improvement.Firstly it's smooth and smells more natural whilst retaining the positive elements of the OG.There are a large number of notes mentioned but one dominates: black soap; it makes the fragrance luxurious. If you don't like soapy scents this isn't for you.So beautiful smell and it creates a nice scent bubble. Longevity and projection are moderate; typical of a parfum, it's designed to be intimate.Very good but not blind but safe.8/10"

This release of invictus is definitely top tier. I first saw it on their website and was on the fence about buying even though Paco Rabanne offers a try it first before you commit to keeping it, but I stumbled upon it at a Macy's and was able to try it there and immediately bought the biggest size right then and there. It's a very well blended fragrance and has a lot of depth to it rather than just being another freshie like a lot of the Invictus fragrances are. Highly recommend this for any time of the year, or any occasion. It smells sophisticated, but not overpowering. Very pleasant to smell."

Some smelled ok but I never put anything from the collection on my buy list . This for my attention with the top notes being some of my favorites and the addition of cashmere and musk. Plus is having the intensity of a Parfum . For a tester and used it for a few days . I must say this is going to be an eventual purchase for me. Its a very clean nice balance of fresh marine and musk. But with that parfum strength is almost very slightly oily on the dry down. It has a light sweetness in the base that makes me think of a very light coconut oil. Performance isn't too shabby . 5 sprays , neck chest and shirt projected a good 3 hours. And didn't becomes a close skin scent until about the 5th hour. Which isn't bad by today's standards . This is also very versatile and can be worn all year day and night ."

This is simply invictus legend in a new bottle. Just as acqua di Gio parfum is Profumo in a new bottle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I think this fragrance is phenomenal. I think it's a 10/10. I bought the 100mL and wish I'd gotten the 200mL. I can see where people are coming from comparing it to Legend, but I think it's so much better. I had actually bought Legend long before it was discontinued, but I ended up returning it. After it got discontinued, I kind of regretted returning the 200mL of it that I'd bought, but Invictus Parfum eliminates that regret.I'm not as picky now as I used to be with fragrances, and I'd probably keep Legend today. At the time, it was too sweet and bubble gummy for me, too juvenile. It was so loud and immature smelling that it was one of the only fragrances I had that felt a little bit silly to wear. Invictus Parfum dials back the sweetness a lot. It's the least sweet Invictus fragrance ever made. The soapiness also makes this a much more balanced fragrance. They literally perfected the Invictus DNA with Invictus Parfum and made it more versatile and appropriate for adults. Invictus Victory, Victory Elixir and Platinum are kind of their own thing, but within the core DNA Invictus fragrances like OG/Aqua/Legend, Invictus Parfum is by far the best scent.The performance is really long lasting with a moderate projection and sillage. Even though the projection is moderate, it stays that way for hours and doesn't dial back to a skin scent until around 8 hours. This fragrance has my favorite type of performance where it's never super loud, but projects moderately and consistently for a long time.The reason I give this a 10 is because I never expected them to improve the Invictus DNA this much."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I had always wanted to get the original invictus but I never did because it was too sweet for my taste, upon trying a sample of this, I immediately bought a bottle. The opening still has that bubblegum sweetness to it but with the added soapy and lavender notes it rounds out the scent into a more mature and pleasant version of the OG. The performance could be better for the price but still not horrible. I would definitely recommend waiting for the price on this to go down but when it does I would suggest picking up a bottle. 8/10."

Overall it’s good asf so don’t listen to the people talking crap but do smell it before you buy bc it cost a good amount."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"An enhancement of the original formula. Sharp, metallic and practical for a mainstream men's release. Nothing about Invictus Parfum stands out among designer releases, other than the fact that it is not Parfum. I personally don't even feel this qualifies as an EDT Intense. Mostly marine notes detected with semi sweet soapy nuances, which unfortunately drowns out other existing notes. The soapiness reminds me of Prada Luna Rossa Ocean in ways. The color gold usually indicates the presence of deeper or warmer notes, but nothing to report here. In conclusion, this is another familiar freshie-aquatic for the masses.While Invictus Parfum is not a terrible fragrance, it allows yet another option among Invictus flankers for those who either prefer this scent profile or looking to get their feet wet in the world of perfume."

The soapy accord is noticeable but for me it makes the whole composition smell a bit like red vines candy. It's not bad at all but I guess I expected more from this one. You definitely will smell good wearing it and I've got to say it gets very, very smooth in the drydown, so it does feel like a parfum. Sillage and longevity are moderate but Legend and Victory Elixir are nuclear compared to this one. I would call this one Invictus for grown ups, the bubblegum vibe is still present but just more restrained and not so juvenile here, so if you're older but still enjoy this kind of scent profile it's worth checking out for sure. It could easily be a signature scent and feels like it would be versatile for wearing year round. That said, I would personally take something like Hawas Ice over this any day of the week. Nice overall but a pass for me."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I enjoy this. Smells like 80% Invictus Legend mixed with 20% Victory Elixir. Salty, aquatic and fresh with a sexy edge. This is my favorite designer release of 2024 so far. Paco Rabanne is definitely headed in the right direction and I’m here for it.UPDATE: Got rid of my bottle after a few wearings because the dry down is a cheap synthetic ambroxan bomb mess. What a disappointment. Sample before you buy, kids!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I was excited to try this and am pleasantly surprised by it. A way more refined and smooth Invictus, similar to Legend but way more quality. Smooth musks and slightly woody powderiness. Toned down bubblegum sweetness that isn’t cloying yet still retains a slight sweetness. Very fresh and addictive soapy qualities as well. I did get a lot of lavender in the opening but it faded out as it dried down more. Slight aquaticness to it as well but more so marine than watery.Relatively potent juice as 2 sprays radiates for about 3 hours and lasted 8-9 hours on skin. Sad to see designer prices sky rocketing the past couple years, as they’re still expensive on discounters but this is a good buy if you find it for a good price."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Got my bottle today. This one is closer to the existing Victory Elixir, but slightly less sweet and aquatic. However, it is not the “invictus universe” which it comes anywhere close, really more of a sibling to Victory Elixir."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Just got this today its ok 👍 if you smelled the the first 4 invictus this is all of them put into one bottle = Invictus Parfum 2024. The smell is heavenly but if you smelled one invictus you smelled them all (the first four). I would say the scent is very versatile and could be worn spring summer nights winter and fall. Good release it's like a mix of Invictus Legend and Invictus Onyx. 7/10 for me.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Wow this stuff stay for a long time.. and i mean long! Super soapy, musky, woody and having the Invictus DNA too. It now works for all seasons having a small dose of dark blue touches in the dry down. Legend was a straight up ocean bomb. This tho isn't clawing at all.. pretty smooth :) It's a hit in my books.. step up in age group but still young (16-35) great job 11/10Song: Forever Young- Alphaville"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Reminds me a bit of legend but there's something in this that gives me liquor vibes. Performance isn't that great it's average. Overall I like it
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,this just a better invictus original. worth
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This stinks. Period. Not a fan of this at all. It’s almost as if they made the original more earthy and brown smelling. This is a pass for sure
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Nothing interesting. It performs worse than Legend and Platinum. Poor projection.More rounded and quiet version of OG/Platinum. Mix of Legend and V Elixir.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"people are r bombing it,it is not worth 3.9/5 at least 4.1"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"To me this is a smooth combination of if PR took the original Invictus EDT and blended with Legend; but added Lavender,and a Soapy accord. This is the most elegant of the Fresher Invictus fragrances which makes it suitable for guys 30+, while still having enough of a youthful kick younger guys to wear it as well. Aquatic, Soapy, Aromatic, some soft Woods, and Muskiness in the dry down. Well done Rabanne this is a worthy Parfum edition."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This fragrance is just right on point, very versatile and well balanced.- Opening: Lavender and spice is really balanced, well tuned. (Can't really smell the aquatic scents on my nose)- Dry down: The soap, little floral and musk + cashmeranis scent really nice, gives that clean woody smell. Decent longevity and sillage (2 hours of protection, skin scent after 7 hours, stays for 9+ hours on my clothes).Overall Rating: 8.5/10, best of all the Invictus line for warmer weathers, well done."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I tested this when it arrived in Sephora. It's quite good but is less fresh and has a more soapy scent. It doesn't smell like the other Invictuses by close, and I felt like it dries down fast. For me, I wouldn't get this instead, I would go for the Platinum one. The bottle is more unique though and it has a good atomizer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Fragrance Notes:Top Notes: Marine Notes, Lavender, Pink Pepper.Mid Notes: Soap, Violet Leaf, Myrtle.Base Notes: Cashmeran, Musk, Sandalwood.Fragrance Review:First thoughts, this is an aromatic/Soapy/Woody scent ""Blue"" scent.- Invictus Parfum starts with a strong blast of aromatic Lavender, Violet Leaf/ Pink Pepper scent for the first 10 minutes. After about 30 minutes it turns to a soapy woody scent.- I sprayed a total of 5 times. Twice behind each ear, twice on the front of neck, and once in front of my chest. The longevity is great, it lasts approximately 6+ hours on my skin, and 9+ on my clothes. This fragrance projects great too, a 6ft radius for the first 30 minutes before turning into a skin scent. (Depends on skin types)Overall Rating (8/10)Smelling similar to Invictus Legend as well as YSL L'homme Le Parfum, makes this fragrance quite redundant/ non innovative. Scent wise, it's amazing, a generic crowd pleasing scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Musky, sweet and warm soap + a deeper, more mature version of EdT. Good longevity and sillage. Best Invictus with Aqua."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,so similar with edt version nothing too special
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It’s a hybrid of the Og but less aquatic and fresh, more subtle and soapy. Dry down is sweet, NOT SUPER SWEET, but quite similar to Victory Elixir. I’d say get V Elixir over this, as it’s a better performer. But if you don’t have this or the OG, this might be for you. I’d say you could wear this scent all year round, but with V Elixir, you wouldn’t. Won’t blow your mind, if you’ve interacted with the other Invictus lineups."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Smells like Invictus EDT at first but becomes a bit more dark and mature, not as loud as the original and the longevity is not great. Its smells good but if you have the original or any of the other flankers its a bit redundant to own. If you want a softer and less loud Invictus this is for you."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I’ve had the chance to test this twice. On my skin smells quite similar to Invictus Legend.Performance is very good, last a long time while projection is moderate towards strong for a little over two hours.I will not be buying it, though the bottle is the best looking one from this line."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"They axed Legend to create pretty much the same fragrance. Why? So they can sell it EXPENSIVE.However, I'm glad they brought my fav Invictus back to life. 👍"

I am quite surprised how good it is!! It's sweet but in a mature way, the added soap note makes this formulation more interesting, really really good longevity on my skin, anyone saying this doesn't last long is trolling, my skin isn't the best for fragrances for longevity, this is a solid release"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Finally got my nose on this (Boots UK), and its exactly what I was hoping for. I absolutely love the OG invictus, and this feels like a more potent stepped up version of that. Retains that bubblegum sweetness, with a soapy mentholy kick that I just love. Waiting for it to hit the discounters and this will be my summer go to scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I wonder how this compares against the new 2024 Profondo Parfum? (NOT THE EDP)
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Just smells like a bar of soap. Not unpleasant but just smells like you've washed your hands with a bar of soap. I sampled it in Boots on my hand and it just smelled like that all day. Sniffing it up close even has the same stingy effect as having soap near your eyes.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"@danzigger, I haven’t tried them in ages and was very underwhelmed by Platinum.The OG is OK although I’ve never felt driven to own a FB. Legend was good but ultimately too sweet for me, a little cloying despite the up top freshness.I only tried the Parfum on the back of my hand and so my opinion is not worth too much I’m afraid.I liked it more than Platinum (which was boring and nondescript to my nose) and it’s less sweet and cloying than Legend.I would have to try it again for a full wearing, but samples simply aren’t out there.It was nice but didn’t seem to be very potent TBH and was faint after only an hour or so.As I said, not a real wearing so please don’t take my word for it.I liked it but would want to try the new ADG Profondo EDP and Parfum before committing as I only need one decent marine frag."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Now available in Boots (UK).Just tried in on my hand.Very nice but nothing especially different or mind blowing.It’s definitely the Invictus DNA but not the same.I get some florals and some soapiness.Will need to try again but it is nice.I don’t think it’s very potent though.I’d consider a bottle but definitely not for full RRP.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Does anybody get the Kenzo Homme Intense vibe from it?
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Full of cinnamon. I am surprised nobody compared it to Wanted By Night.Very nice fragrance btw.In fact it is half way between Invictus OG and Wanted by Night.Projects very well!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,It is like a hybryd of Legend + OG but smells excellent. Projection is great. It will be my go to fragrance for spring and summer for sure 🔥
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Pretty similar to platinum but a bit more rounder, complex. Opening is very invictus style. I believe that it shines in the dry down way more. I actually love it on my skin after 4-5 hours, it’s really really good in the dry down. Bottle is really nice as well. Very classic bubblegum opening, but much darker and woodsier later."

The worst decision ever PR House made!Eventhough the new perfume version isn t bad at all. Almost the same as edp now it s called perfume and costs double price.That’s the business nowdays.Alltogether I like it and yes the bottle design is also amazing. Nice job from the house but not as good as the EDP."

This is very musky, with some aquatic, fresh and clean notes. ALOT of musk and cashmeran I get in this, marine notes, lavender while there is also what feels to be salt. First time reminded me of Elixir and Platinum. 1 spray and the projection is still doing fairly good, can fill up a room with 1-2. This does feel versatile, for any season, day or night."

As for getting it, I really recommend it because, as I said in the previous comment, the performance is really solid. Maybe not like Invictus Victory Elixir, but it's not far (maybe 1-2 hours less than it, but it still goes over 12 hours no problem)"

I’m a huge fan of this DNA and I can’t wait to get my hands on this new flanker. Glad to hear that performance is on point. Would you say that this has anything in common with Invictus Legend?

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I have it, and all I can say is that this is going to blow up like bleu de chanel did back in the day, or at least how OG invictus did. It's very soapy, fresh, clean, that it can be worn any time, every time. As far as performance goes, I can't say anything because I just bought it today and didn't test it, but it looks promising. Plus I don't know any invictus that has bad performance so I don't worry about that too much.Edit: with 2 sprays on my hand, it goes well over 12 hours with very good projection. Keep in mind I work in a butchery and I get sweaty and I also washed my hands but this is still projecting a little bit now, when I'm writing this review.Solid solid fragrance and I'm 100% sure it will blow up like crazy, almost the new sauvage because the performance is this good and the scent profile works literally any second of the day.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,BEST INVICTUS BOTTLE DESIGN YET
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I have it, and all I can say is that this is going to blow up like bleu de chanel did back in the day, or at least how OG invictus did. It's very soapy, fresh, clean, that it can be worn any time, every time. As far as performance goes, I can't say anything because I just bought it today and didn't test it, but it looks promising. Plus I don't know any invictus that has bad performance so I don't worry about that too much.Edit: with 2 sprays on my hand, it goes well over 12 hours with very good projection. Keep in mind I work in a butchery and I get sweaty and I also washed my hands but this is still projecting a little bit now, when I'm writing this review.Solid solid fragrance and I'm 100% sure it will blow up like crazy, almost the new sauvage because the performance is this good and the scent profile works literally any second of the day. I love it!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Okay, so they have gotten the fragrance here in a mall where I live. The bottle design is just amazing! it smells like YSL Y EDP, but not as fruity. It's more of a soapy lavender scent, kind of niche. But it's really good! Even though there's no vanilla listed in the fragrance, I do get a little hint of it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As a niche guy, I blind bought this on a whim after hearing about the soapy vibe.It's a synthetic designer, doesn't smell very high quality, and it's sweet.With that said, for whatever reason, I like it. Not too loud or ridiculous but fun and appealing.I'd say thumbs up. In the world of fragrances, this is like fast food. Cheap, uninteresting, fairly low quality, but for some reason it's good on occasion.A pleasant, appealing guilty pleasure.8/10."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"..just arrived. First spray and opening reminds me of Victory Elixir and after few seconds its definitely close to Invictus Legend.. its good, but Legend is much better for me.. 7/10. ( and yes, it is musky )."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Rabanne/Invictus-Parfum-90433.html,Invictus Parfum Rabanne cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As much as I really wanted to love it, I just can't.The opening is sickly sweet, and opens up like grape bubblegum soda, with something plastic tagging along. It stays in that opening stage for a few hours before it finally begins to slowly mellow out into something that resembles Invictus Legend, but only slightly. There isn't much olfactory depth after that.I had high expectations, but this is just too pedal to the metal sickly sweet in the opening, it's almost like they took the sweetness from Phantom and ramped it up to 11, but forgot to actually mellow it down within the first few moments of the perfume's life on your skin. But hey, if you're into that sort of sweet perfumery, this is right up your alley."

The sweetness is not too pleasant to my nose either, it smells like the bruised part of a banana tastes like. If you like the scent, you're in luck because the performance is actually good."

I mainly get the plum & sandalwood. The hazlenut rounds out the edges while giving it a slight nutty feel. Apparently clary sage is in here but I barely pick it up. Not really gourmand but definitely fruity. Fairly unisex imo
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This has to be my no1 designer fragrance of the year! No sign of chemical notes in this one which you do get in some other JPGs.The plum at the top is unique and lasts at least 6hrs, fantastic for a top note, I've never known performance like it for one single note.The chestnut and sandalwood create a beautifully blended creamy composition and this stuff lasts at least 10hrs on skin. It's a beast mode performer and for the price, very hard to compete with. 10/10"

As someone who has smelled the entire scandal line, this is by far my favorite. I read the comments that saying “mirabelle stinks, it made me vomit etc...” and I completely disagree.I haven’t smelled a fruit gives such a nice smell before.Also I was missing the One Million Lucky, this fragrance is not the same but it gives me the same feelings and the young soul when I was wearing 1M lucky."

The chestnut note adds warmth, creating a sense of caramelized chestnuts. The sandalwood in the base offers a creamy, woody smoothness that holds everything together beautifully.Compared to the original Scandal, Absolu is a richer and more concentrated version. The sweetness here is more refined, giving it a creamy, gourmand touch without being overpowering. The chestnut and sandalwood shine, making this perfect for fall and winter evenings. It projects well without being overwhelming, making it ideal for intimate settings or colder weather.With its excellent longevity, you can expect this fragrance to last for hours, keeping its warm and inviting presence. For fans of sweet and nutty scents, this one is a must-try, as it manages to stay comforting while still being undeniably luxurious.In Short: A rich, warm, and creamy fragrance with caramelized chestnut and sandalwood. Perfect for cool evenings and long-lasting."

I have Naxos and although I think it smells amazing I don’t feel as good wearing it as I do wearing pure masculine fragrance. Perhaps it’s my lack of preference for these sweeter, gourmand type fragrances that my brain doesn’t pick up the nuances up in them as well as other types, and with that being said, if I was into these types of fragrances, I would buy this over Naxos because of the price difference"

With its sweet, nutty vibe, it’s like putting on a confident, sophisticated suit in a bottle. Ideal for cooler days and long-lasting, but easy on the sprays unless you want to make a big entrance. If you’re into gourmand scents, this one’s definitely worth a try. Let’s keep it under the radar so we can stay smelling unique!"

I've tried all three Scandals, and this one definitely took the favorite crown. The first time I've smelt Mirabelle in a fragrance (I commonly grew up with the fruit, but in desserts and cakes and other shit like that, lmao), and JPG once again excelled with this release. This is an evening scent for sure because of the dry down, but due to the Mirabelle, I could see a guy pulling it off on a summer date night. For the rest of the seasons, go for it. VERY good longevity (the most out of the three Scandals), around 12 hours with 3 hours of decent projection (5 sprays should suffice)."

Then Scandal Le Parfum came out, and it's one of the best Sandalwood fragrances ever made. It had more versatility and maturity than the EDT. The Le Parfum is so smooth.Scandal Absolu is fantastic. It has that strong Sandalwood base, but the chestnut adds an interesting layer. At times, its reminiscent of the SWY line. It has great longevity like the whole Scandal line. All JPG's are good projectors, but it doesn't push quite as much as the Le Parfum imo. If you enjoy sweet fragrances or any of the Scandal line, then you'll like this. It's another great release by JPG."

Drying down to the kitchen of an old women whose friend has come to watch her make a fruit bread, but is disturbed by her choice to use cumquat of all possible fruits to choose from. Wear this if you would like to smell like the inside of a pastry chefs wardrobe, where they exclusively leave their work outfits and cigar smoking jackets.

It's opening reminded me a lot of Le Male Elixir but it sets itself apart on the dry down. Warm, sweet, lovely, and an amazing performer. It's similar to many things on the market but can still be used to set yourself apart from any SWY or 1 million or Le Male Elixir users. A good release from JPG!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Just tried Abslou from a sample I received from JPG and I must say that I like it. I would probably buy it, if I didn't already have 1 Million Parfum. I can see that others are picking up on this similarity, which I confirm (also performance wise).1MP and SA are definitely not 1:1. In its dry down, SA is slightly more woody/chestnutty and doesn't really smell like a solar lotion, but rather creamy. On the other hand, 1MP has a stronger ""solar"" note.All in all, in my opinion they are similar enough to the point of being redundant.If you like the Scandal line, make sure that you try the EdT which in my opinion is still the best one, with great performance/longevity despite the concentration."

This is yet another gem. Out of all the fragrances I tried at the mall this one called out to me the most. It projects very well and it holds up. You do notice the JPG DNA on this, wouldn't say it's sweet or gourmand, it's kind of boozy yet nutty to me instead, alluring. The opening is surprisingly feminine as it could pass as a female fragrance but it quickly goes away and gets more masculine in the dry down. Would recommend in your rotation for date nights during fall-winter. Get this if you are looking for good sillage and duration for your money."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,To me the opening is unisex with a feminine lean. That kind of subsides after a while and it gets a little less perfumey. Not bad for younger guys that want to smell sweet. The drydown gives me a much less metallic much lighter PDM Pegasus. I like it overall but it's definitely for a different audience. I'm in my 40s so I don't really club or do fancy parties so I won't have many occasions to wear this. If I were to attend something fancy I'd want to wear something more age appropriate. Performance is nothing special at least for me. It's very sweet in the opening and then it just starts tapering off. I got a 50 ml and I know to last forever. It's going into the cupboard so I can dust it off once a year and wear it.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I owe Scandal Absolu a second review. I wrote mt first impressions some months ago where I said that it is mostly the same as the original Scandal. That isn't completely wrong but it doesn't tell you the whole story. I compared the original and the Absolu more closely, side by side on my skin this time and this is how they comapre:- The Absolu doesn't have the synthetic green-ish freshness that is the backbone of the original. This is one of the main differences in the smell between the two to me. That means the orignal smells fresher, greener and lighter. Absolu smells smoother, creamier and sweeter. I'd say it actually isn't sweeter but the absence of the fresh backbone lets the sweet notes take even more of a center stage.- Absolu lasts longer. I can still clearly smell it on my arm 22 hours later. The projection is very strong (not after almost a full day obviously). The original isn't a weak scent by any means but Absolu is on another level. I'd say this is one of the longest lasting designer scents I've ever smelled. It lasts longer than for example Le Male Elixir or 1 Million Elixir, I'd say this is Sauvage Elixir level performace (for better or worse depends on you).- I don't get a nutty note that would make this similar to 1M Lucky or SWY Absolutely/Intensenly. They are scents in a similar ballpark but they do not really smell alike.- I am now convinced this is an improvement over the original Scandal and if you are considering getting one fragrance from this line I'd suggest you choose Absolu.- All that said Absolu and the original are still fairly similar scents, at least 80% the same if not more. I don't think you need to get Absolu if you own the original or Le Parfum (I do not mention Le Parfum in my comparison because I have only smelled it once.)"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It's such a ""scandalous"" fragrance from the beginning to the end. It's absolutely a ""wow!"" when you first spray it on the skin. It has to be on skin! (like most fragrances) There's definitely a big presence for a long period of time and very noticeable. Great performer for sure. And there's definitely that JPG-esque funk in the back bone more so this time from the JPG Classique for some reason particularly from ""Classique Intense EDP"" if any of you ever smelled or tried that one. I have that one for myself as I love it and almost the end of the bottle although it's meant for ladies'. ""Scandal Pour Homme Absolu"" starts with the combination of big burst of fruits bomb with vanilla and not sure if that is chestnut but it has that warm ""funk"" that carries almost the entire life of the fragrance and then many hours later, the scent becomes creamy still sweet vanilla and woody but in the background. They only list 3 notes but I know there are way more than just 3 notes in this smooth yet loud big performer. Come on! Super long lasting, projector and the scent bubble keeps pulsating the entire time. If you don't have a sweet tooth, you might want to stay away from this one. It's absolutely a gourmand fragrance. 👍🏼👍🏼🤩"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Just got a 150ml bottle of this and damn it is gorgeous! In a nutshell this smells like a much more refined, warmer and toned down version of the original Scandal but with an added chestnut note. It is pretty sweet but it has a fruity freshness and somehow actually feels on the lighter side to me. I must have doused myself with 12 sprays of this juice and even with that many it is not too much or cloying. It is impeccably blended and smells incredibly smooth and ever so slightly creamy. Doesn’t lean too youthful or mature, so any age can wear this in my opinion. It’s the most versatile in the line. Performance is really solid, it leaves a very noticeable sillage in the first couple hours then after that it settles closer to the skin, perfect for close encounters. All three Scandals are great but this newest one feels like the “Goldilocks” flanker, everything is just right here and extremely well balanced. Awesome release and I really look forward to wearing this during the cooler days and nights."

Leans sweet and for hot weather. Turns into a smooth buttery tanning lotion, with that OG scandal Grey vanilla base. This is one of the sexiest thing I've smelled in a while. Scandal OG isn't as sexy as this. NOTE I haven't smelled scandal parfum, simply the edt. This is easily half a step above the EDT."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"A huge improvement to the Scandal line. Unlike a review I saw, I wouldn’t call it mature but it is indeed an elegant scent for younger gents. Definitely a fragrance that aligns with gourmand aspects of Stronger with You, Le Male Elixir, and Xerjoff Naxos.Unlike the other Scandals, I prefer this one a bit more, it is much balanced and has more depth than the other flankers. It is less youthful in some sense but it still can be easily be pulled off by many, whether of which age, however, subjectively it is not my taste, but I can appreciate the blend of this fragrance. My brother, actually bought this and he let me use it for a day. I have to say, that the performance on my skin is great, 8 hours plus, and loud projection, so please, you young teenagers that hyped the JPG Fragrances to death, better be careful with the sprays, and not go full on Axe body spray on it.Jokes aside, my only knock on this fragrance is its price, but knowing Jean Paul Gaultier fragrances often or always shown in discounters. My advice is to find a discount of it, so you would get your money’s worth, and definitely not have your money wasted, or should I say the money from your parents? Just kidding, anyways a good fragrance but personally not my taste 8/10."

Initial spray it’s not cloying it’s very noticeable and strong. But after about 2-3hours it sat closer to me maybe a foot or less but I kept getting whiffs of it. I’m not into super sweet scents and that’s why I have never tried any scandal before, this is my first but my gosh. I normally don’t wear the same fragrance 3 times in a row but this one I have. I know that it’s “simple and done before” but I’ve smelt a lot i own a moderate amount and know what I like and not everyone is the same for me this is addictive. I wish it was a little stronger at projection but tbh this will work nicely and a cool windy spring day that wind just blows past and brings that scent to life. So good."

But the drydown is really nice nutty and woody with some added sweetness i really like the Drydown. It lasts long on my skin tho give or take 8 hours. With moderate projection. I would use this Fragrance on a really cold Winter day
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is a sweet fragrance that is not extremely loud. It conserves much of the OG's caramelly DNA but less screechy, and more dark and creamy. And it lasts less on my skin, which for me it's a good thing. I'm a 47 y/o man and I have a hard time finding a sweet scent that is not juvenile or a projection bomb. I wanted something smoother and milder, Absolu checks all my boxes.The opening is citrusy and fruity, very very nice. The dry down is really nice, with the caramel scent and added creamy sandalwood notes. I have worn it to the office a couple of days and it hasn't gotten me any compliments yet. I do 4-6 sprays and I can feel it's there without being cloying. It starts to fade a little bit around the 5th hour. This is something I could wear to a party, a family event, or even a date night. Where I live here in Canada is very cold and dry, which will allow me to wear it for at least 8 out of 12 months of the year.If you own the OG and are a younger guy, I would say this will result redundant. But if you don't own any of this line,and if you like the DNA but want the most versatile version of it, I would say go for Absolu.I hope this helps."

I can only compare it to Scandal Le Parfum, not the original, and I have to say that the opening is really similar. I love Le Parfum, and I have to say that this one is really long lasting as well (maybe just a little bit less than Le Parfum). The sillage is also perfectly impressive. The drydown is where it's a bit different from Le Parfum, like a little bit less sweet, a bit more nutty. It's enjoyable, I really like it. However, I don't feel like you need it if you already have Le Parfum, as I read a lot of people comparing it to the original also.If you don't have the other flankers, you might want to choose this one if you prefer this one more, but it's a very slight difference, I feel."

In my opinion it's not completely redundant if you have the OG Scandal, here you get a different type of sweetness, way more creamy and dense. But yeah, after like 3-4 hours Scandal Absolu and Scandal EDT smells basically the same.I would say this is a really well done flanker but apparently it doesn't project like the OG which is still the strongest and louder of the line."

It's more of a fruiter and smoother version.- Scandal Absolu starts with a strong blast of Fruity Chestnut sweetness scent for the first 10 minutes. After about 30 minutes it turns to a warm woody scent. Very similar to Paco Rabanne One Million Lucky.- I sprayed a total of 5 times. Twice behind each ear, twice on the front of neck, and once in front of my chest. The longevity is great, it lasts approximately 7-10 hours on my skin, and a full day on my clothes. This fragrance projects great too, a 6ft radius for the first 30 minutes before turning into a skin scent. (Depends on skin types)Overall Rating (8.5/10)A good release, but may be redundant if you already owned the original Scandal/ Scandal Le Parfum. You may prefer this over the others, or you may not, so it's entirely how you like this fragrance.Probably the best Designer’s release of the year(2024)"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Too sweet, linear and boring scent. The mirabelle note is nice but that's all there is to it. Longevity is good and projection OK. If you're younger than 20 or new to perfumes then you might like this.Ladies will like it too if you care about that but I would say it's because it is leaning more feminine than masculine.If you're looking for something unique or at least more masculine just skip this one, not worth your time nor money."

Smooth and sweet fragrance that'd be perfect for winter. It should have released 6 months ago but it is what it is. I can see this become a pretty popular fragrance for colder months. It's not super unique but it's not boring at all. It's more male leaning but a girl could wear this imo.I wouldn't judge performance for now. JPG doesn't let their fragrances macerate I think. When Le Mâle Élixir got released it lasted 7-8 hours on my skin with no projection. Now it lasts 12+ easily and projects heavily. This already performs beastly on my skin though.

If you own the EDT and or the Le Parfum I would say that Absolu is not redundant, definitely give it a spritz! Now, my thoughts. Absolu is less sweet than the EDT and Le Parfum, I definitely get Chestnut in the opening and some ‘booziness’ Absolu is very smooth, extremely well blended and is quite addictive! I also detect a little ‘fruitiness’ as Absolu begins to slowly dry down. Performance is on par with the EDT and Le Parfum, I get a solid 7-8 hours of projection, Absolu lasts all day on my skin and it definitely lingers on clothing. If you can, give it a try!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Scandal-Pour-Homme-Absolu-91053.html,Scandal Pour Homme Absolu Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Just tested it half an hour ago on my hand along with the original side by sideThe OG is fresher and definitely more projecting in the opening while the ABSOLU with quite fresh in the opening but after a few minutes it settled down and I started to pick up the chestnut and I can definitely tell that it's really dark and sweet and it's really awesomeAs a summary I can tell that it's an autumn/winter gourmand fragrance that can be used in spring too... Still don't know too much about the performance but IMO it's really promisingDefinitely on my list as a next purchase ❤️

After letting it dry down i kept smelling more of the scandal dna but it turned into a summery type of fragrance. Its absolutely beautiful and smells soo good i think u can wear it every season."

The original already was intense , this one is even more concentrated and dense, which is ,of course, to be expected. Very fresh and sweet plum opening note which wears off real slow , gives way to the chestnut base. Think original Scandal pour Homme edt combined with the chestnut in EA 's Stronger With You Absolutely and you get the idea. No need to say that with Gaultier , you get worth your money in the longevity department. For now , thumbs up!"

I can see the similarity between the OG Scandal and Scandal Absolu. This is a more intense, woody, powdery, also very sweet and nutty version. You can smell the OG DNA for sure though. The notes that are listed don’t do this fragrance justice and you should definitely smell it in store like most fragrances."

It conserves much of the OG's caramelly DNA but less screechy, and more dark and creamy. And it lasts less on my skin, which for me it's a good thing. I'm a 47 y/o man and I have a hard time finding a sweet scent that is not juvenile or a projection bomb. I wanted something smoother and milder, Absolu checks all my boxes.The opening is citrusy and fruity, very very nice. The dry down is really nice, with the caramel scent and added creamy sandalwood notes. I have worn it to the office a couple of days and it hasn't gotten me any compliments yet. I do 4-6 sprays and I can feel it's there without being cloying. It starts to fade a little bit around the 5th hour. This is something I could wear to a party, a family event, or even a date night. Where I live here in Canada is very cold and dry, which will allow me to wear it for at least 8 out of 12 months of the year.If you own the OG and are a younger guy, I would say this will result redundant. But if you don't own any of this line,and if you like the DNA but want the most versatile version of it, I would say go for Absolu.I hope this helps."

The mirabelle note is nice but that's all there is to it. Longevity is good and projection OK. If you're younger than 20 or new to perfumes then you might like this.Ladies will like it too if you care about that but I would say it's because it is leaning more feminine than masculine.If you're looking for something unique or at least more masculine just skip this one, not worth your time nor money."

Drying down to the kitchen of an old women whose friend has come to watch her make a fruit bread, but is disturbed by her choice to use cumquat of all possible fruits to choose from. Wear this if you would like to smell like the inside of a pastry chefs wardrobe, where they exclusively leave their work outfits and cigar smoking jackets.

Smells similar to Afnan Supremacy Silver not only intense but more natural. Bit of Mont Blanc Explorer, but without ambroxan. Not so close to Aventus, especially not Aventus Cologne.Seems like a nice parfum, but wouldn't pay more than $30-40 for it. When this thing hits discounters, I'll think about it. Hope this helps."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Taking into account the price you can get it for and what it offers, this is a great scent. Good longevity, good projection, scent profile that is over-done, but still has something to offer.If you go to ""Reminds me of"" section, I will pick Eros Energy over all of them without hesitation.Creed is overpriced, not worth the price-tag it has. Armaf I wouldn't even comment, awful quality and pathetic performance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"In my opinion, Eros Energy is kind of over-hated.Like yes, this isn’t super original or overly interesting, the release was a disaster with delays and whatnot, but with all that aside, I think this is generally a pretty good cologne. It’s zingy, bright and a bit sweet.I’ll be honest, you shouldn’t buy this YET considering most retailers are pricing this at $150-160 for 100ml. It’s hitting discounters starting at $115CAD for 100ml which is already a solid price for a new release. If you wait like 6-12 additional months it’ll probably be just south of what Eros Flame costs.I know a lot of the negative ratings so far have to do with review bombers and kids who heard their favourite fragrance influencer bash this for “smelling like aventus,” it doesn’t. I wanna bet a lot of the people leaving bad reviews haven’t even smelt this yet considering it just now made it to retailers.7/10 as of October 2024, I’ll probably pick this up in Q2 2025 once the price has dropped considerably."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I did get me a bottle of it. I love it but at first I wasn't sure. It is dam good but it just seems weak to me. Hopefully it will get better. I know it's new so it just needs to sit for a little bit
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"on the opening is just a straight blastful surge of that blood orange , kinda like you split a orange in half and put your nose in it, other that its very citrusy and it does seem to kind go in that ""creed / montblanc explorer"" like dry down , i dont own those fragrances but I smelled the montblanc explorer and the dry down is somewhat similar. Other than that i think its a pretty dope fragrance in my opinion."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Went into this with low expectations but wow it’s really nice! Fresh, citrusy, a bit sour. It smells as good as the lemon head candy tastes. I do smell some similarities with Aventus. This is the best Eros.9/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is a much better version of Mont Blanc Explorer.As everyone has said, this opens up with a super blast of bergamot and lime. There are other citruses too, but these are the main players.After a few minutes you can start to smell the base notes emerge. Whereas Mont Blanc Explorer base came off unpleasant and jarring (I gave it away), this Energy's base continues to smell good. I still smell this on my skin after 18 hours.For the money, just get Insurrection Pure II."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This does not smell like Aventus at all. It's completely missing the pineapple sweetness/freshness and the smoky birch. All this is, at least to my nose, is a slightly bitter citrus overdose, like a less sharp version of the opening to Eros Flame.This basically smells like how an aperol spritz tastes. Huge miss in my opinion."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Yes its a nice smelling fragrance but a clear ""jump on the Aventus bandwagon"" case which is a shame for.a brand that once launched individual fragrances like Versus Uomo, Blue Jeans or The Dreamer. RIP Gianni!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Ok, tried this at my local Macy's. And YES this is Aventus DNA for sure. Once the citrus blast fades after 30min, your left with a synthetic oakmoss heavy base with clean woods. It actually reminded me a lot like Zara Vibrant Leather...which is a cheap Aventus clone. This is similar ...and lighter, citrus forward clone.It's not bad smelling, but totally redundant if you already have any sort of Aventus DNA frags in your collection. I'm passing on this one."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,At the opening is a blast of citruses. After one hour it's like Aventus. Poor longevity and silllage. That's all.

This is more elegant masculine with great strong citrus opening,it reminds the explorer thats true but better quality. Last long also ...Honestly if it wasn't called Eros it would be Better."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Short but correct answer for Eros Energy. Explorer with green lemon peel in it. Dry down is a same Explorer, with my nose this is a leather scent or patchouli scent vibe"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Tested today. No. Nope. No way. Way too citrusy. Sorry for the person that buys this. Not true to the heart of Eros lineage. It's a pure money grab.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Smelled it at Nordstrom the other day and I have to say this is easily the most citrusy citrus I've ever smelled
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I heard this fragrance is pretty similar to Creed Aventus but less in-your-face for not having the pineapple scent. After smelling this, I can say that the claim is 100% true.Although this is not as versatile as Aventus, I prefer this over it.This scent also has the best longevity out of all exclusively citrus fragrances I have tested so far.Definitely a spring-summer day fragrance.I personally like this and would wear this!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,oh love it so yummy fresh citrusy sweet like c vitamin in powder to drink and that bottle looks like gummy
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Purchased from Macy’s.I love the color of the bottle and cap, but…The cologne is very citrus heavy in the opening. I love citrus, but my wife thought it was too much. The opening last for about 3 hours, which is a long time for a citrus opening (I love lemon). She thought the drydown was nice, but not as good as some of my other colognes. The drydown has that soft wood and smokiness in it. It doesn’t project like when you first sprayed it, but it’ll be smelled when you pass by others.If you want an example for the opening, think of Aventus Cologne, but much more rugged lemon and orange oil in it. It does have a very slight smokiness in the background.If you want to buy for yourself, then go for it. It smells great, but if you want to attract somebody near you, then maybe go with something else."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Ja Versace je doet het opnieuw, na al die kostbare flessen Aventus en Cedrat Boise is dit de fijnste Energy van anonieme makers. Ik lever mijn flessen met liefde in!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As others have already indicated, minus the pineapple note, Eros Energy smells similar to Aventus and many of it's clones such as PV/PVI/CDNIM/Explorer/et cetera, especially when it reaches the dry down stage. However, don't be fooled by the citrusy opening, which actually last quite a few hours. 😊 Because Energy actually feels and wears like a dark/heavy/birchy masculine batch of Aventus with citrus notes, opposed to pineapple.Consequently, if you actually own and have given Energy a full days wearing, you will understand why it was incorporated into the Eros line. As Energy's potent base notes of Oakmoss, Musk and Patchouli notes makes it feel like a resinous/citrusy/fragrant winter fragrance, and not a traditional citrusy summer fragrance. The citrus notes simply help to soften and sweeten the base notes and make the fragrance pop and sparkle when you wear it. 🥳Eros Energy is a solid release and worth a full-bottle purchase especially if discounted 15% or more off retail. Performance is almost nuclear too. Most people will yield 24hrs, unless you have pig's skin! 😖🤣😂😃 Energy is an excellent winter fragrance, especially if you want something masculine and different from all the cheap syrupy sweet fall/winter fragrances flooding the market! I suspect Energy will overwhelm mofos that wear it in hot weather and may interpret the base notes as body odor. 💯Overall: 8.75/10 - Only because the Aventus DNA is a bit played out now."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Smells more like CDNIM and Cedrat Boise than Aventus. The notes are accurate I think - this is one of the most citrusy openings ever, so if you are into that it might be worth checking it out. But overally, this was redundant release. And shouldn't be Eros flanker."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It's called ""Eros Energy"" for a reason, because wow that opening is energetic. You get Bautista Bombed by the citrus in the opening. Dry down becomes a lot more tame, reminds me of Sauvage Elixir for some reason. Lasts all day, projects for 4+ hours. This can easily be worn during any season. Has enough potency to be worn in the cold and the dry down is warm enough."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I managed to smell it today. Phenomenal citrus scent! After a short dry down it reminded me and my girlfriend of bvlgari aqva amara perfume. I think I have my scent for next summer!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Eros Energy is a citrus bomb. I have CDNIM, MB Explorer, Aventus, etc. and I am happy that I bought this. I am looking forward to wearing this next summer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This smells like Lemon Calippo. Pure and simple. And it's great. Yes, it's synthetic, it's a synthetic citrus bomb, but it's good. A very brisk, full, fresh, slightly sweet citrus bomb. At 41, I'm a little past the age where I reach for fragrances like the ones in the Eros family. Not that there's anything wrong with that. And that won't surely stop me from acknowledging that this should be a hit of a fragrance, especially among the crowd under 30.The citrus elements remain very present and dominant throughout the very long and seemingly linear drydown, but after an hour or so the oakmoss begins to add a very interesting woody earthy element that pushes this to a slightly more mature level. I guess that's where the association with Aventus comes from, as I don't see any other similarities during the very lively and vibrant citric first couple of hours. The added bonus: the performance on this thing is just fantastic - I did a spray on the back of my hand more than 9 hours ago and it's still VERY noticeable in the air as I write this (funnily enough, didn't last much on paper strip. Go figure). I can't think of a longer lasting, better performing true fresh fragrance in the designer realm right now. Stunning!I only wish I was 20 again...7.5/10"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Very Aventus like, but that epic lemon opening is to die for. Lemon fades to an Aventus Cologne type scent and has lasted for the last 6+ hours and still going. I wish I would have had this juice at the start of summer, but there is always next Sping/Summer!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Tried it on a tester strip in Müller and it smells like lemon, only lemon and just lemon. I like the smell of lemons but this is incredibly one dimensional at least in the opening. Would need to give it a test on skin to try performance but considering how citrus heavy it is i doubt it is good"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,The OG Eros and Flame are quite unique. This new version of Eros is nothing but an impression of Aventus
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The newest entry into Versace's Eros line; Eros Energy. I knew from the moment I tried this off a tester strip at Macy's that I would have to get it. As soon as it came up for sale on discounter websites I scooped it up to complete my Eros collection. I've tried and tested all the scents in the Eros line, and I've loved all of them. Will Energy make it 5 for 5? Let's get into it;Scent:Opening is citrusy, juicy, and bright. The primary notes I get are lemon, lime, blood orange, and grapefruit. The strongest of the notes are the lemon and lime. Both notes are sharp, juicy, and ride the line between realistic and synthetic. This is followed by the blood orange and grapefruit. The blood orange doubles down on the orange-focused citrus and adds a healthy dose of sweetness, while the grapefruit adds a hint of bitter rindy-ness. There's also a creaminess to the opening. I'm not sure where it comes from, but it's definitely noticeable to me and gives the opening a ""yellow starburst candy"" accord to my nose. I think it's absolutely delicious smelling and gives the opening a ""citrus gourmand"" edge. The dry down is citrusy, woody, and fresh. The primary notes I get are lemon, oak moss, blood orange, and black currant. The strongest of the notes are the lemon and oak moss. The lemon still has the same tart and juicy accord from the opening, while the oak moss has accompanied it for a dose of its signature inky woodiness. This is followed by the blood orange and black currant. The blood orange still carries the sweet citrus notes from the opening, and the black currant rounds out the dry down with its signature tangy, green, and slightly ammoniac accord. I know what you're thinking, ""Black currant? So it smells like Creed Aventus?"". In answer to that question; yes but not entirely. The dry down does certainly give me Aventus vibes with the lemon, black currant, and oak moss; so parallels could definitely be drawn between the two. One could almost be fooled into believing this is an Aventus inspired fragrance. But Energy is overall much fresher and citrus forward, and also lacks the smokiness of Aventus. Overall the scent profile of Energy is incredible; the opening is my favorite part but the dry down is equally enjoyable.Performance:Initial projection is strong at around 6 feet. Sillage is enormous with an unmistakeable scent trail. After a few hours the projection and sillage were unchanged, still very strong. At the 7 hour mark the projection was right outside arms length and the scent trail was still noticeable. At around the 10 hour mark the projection was gone but there was still a light scent trail being left. The fragrance became a skin scent shortly thereafter.When to wear:Versace was pretty late to the party waiting until September to release this, because this is a Spring/Summer fragrance through and through. Eros Energy is suited most for daytime and is very easy wearing. While the opening tailor-made for being out in the sun, the dry down gives this fragrance enough versatility to work at the office or on dates as well, just be careful not to overspray.Blind buy:If you like heavy-handed citrus fragrances, or you like the Aventus-style DNA, this is a safe blind buy for you.Final verdict:This fragrance has everything most people are looking for in a fragrance; a mass-appealing scent, powerful performance, versatility, and that compliment factor. Unfortunately fragrance snobs are probably going to hate on this because it's Versace and it's not ""interesting"" enough for their palette, and I can understand that. It's not breaking any molds and it shares strong similarities with the Aventus DNA. But here's the fact of the matter; not every fragrance has to be a deep dive into high art perfumery. The Eros line is one of the best selling men's fragrance lines for a reason, it smells great and gets positive attention. Eros Energy is no exception. Sometimes it's okay to appreciate a fragrance for what it is without trying to compare it to something 3 or 4 times it's price point. This will be joining the rest of the Eros line on my ""love it"" shelf, and I'm not ashamed to say that. Are you?Scent: 10/10Longevity: 8/10Sillage: 8/10"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,UPDATE AFTER 2 WEEKS OF WEARING:This is the perfect scent for the Texas heat-Yea it may be synthetic BUT it smells like creamy citruses and after a few hours it dries down with a lil oakmoss in the equation- This thing has nice silage of my skin too. People be lookin around like ''someone smells gud as hell!''It's usually me... wearing this lol
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Eros Energy by Versace begins with an intense citrus medley, dominated by a sharp lemon note that brings a limoncello-like freshness. This lemon note is the star for the first 20 minutes, but as it starts to mellow, other citrus elements like lime, orange, and mandarin emerge, each contributing its own unique twist. The lime adds a slightly sour, tangy aspect, reminiscent of a cocktail like a Moscow Mule, while the orange and mandarin infuse a subtle sweetness. Together, they create a vibrant, zesty opening that captures the essence of a summer day.As the fragrance develops, the heart and base notes begin to add complexity and depth. Pink pepper introduces a hint of spice, providing a warm contrast to the citrus brightness. The white amber contributes a creamy, slightly sweet undertone that balances the sharpness of the citrus, giving the fragrance a smooth, velvety texture. While the black currant isn't distinctly prominent, it likely plays a role in bridging the fruity top notes with the deeper, more grounded base. This transition is seamless, preventing the fragrance from becoming overly sharp or one-dimensional.In the dry down, the fragrance settles into a harmonious blend where musk and oakmoss come to the forefront, adding a fresh yet earthy finish. The musk enhances the citrus' freshness, while the oakmoss lends a subtle, natural earthiness that lingers on the skin. Patchouli adds a final touch of sweetness and depth. They all rounding out the composition and making it more than just a simple citrus scent. The result is a refreshing, sophisticated fragrance that's perfect for hot summer days, offering both the invigorating zest of citrus and the comforting warmth of earthy, spicy notes.In short: Eros Energy starts with a burst of bright citrus, evolves with spicy and creamy nuances, and finishes with a fresh, earthy base, making it an ideal summer fragrance with a blend of both vibrancy and depth."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I just tried eros energy yesterday and it definitely smells like aventus. even the dry-down is very smokey like the OG.it's the designer version of aventus in my opinion.The opening is a tart pineapple/lemony smell (almost like those emergency Vitamin C powders you mix with water). aventus's opening is sweet pineapple instead.The overall composition is nice but it's just another clone of aventus. Performance is pretty good. I could smell it in the air as i moved around pretty much all day.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Opens with a light, sweet pineapple note, it's a little floral, sparkling, and with a touch of something aquatic.Has a citrus lemon backbone, fruity notes, and smells clean overall. There's a little spice too, and a metallic musk develops after an hour. It's airy and expansive, gets a little sour after 3hrs.Starts to become aromatic after a while on the skin, leans a bit green, has the well known Creed musk accord (which puts the wearer in mind of mountain air.) Has more spice & conifer wood notes, before turning to a lemon aroma again.Performance was good on me, great projection and lasted on the back of my arm until the following morning. It's a persistent smell that does run the risk of becoming boring, even though it's very pleasant.Best for guys, spring and summertime.It did remind me of Aventus, minus the smoky-chypre facets. It feels to me as if Versace realised how popular the pineapple Aventus DNA is, and felt they couldn't afford not to have their own take on it?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Some nice refreshing citrus notes on top. After and hour there's only a little patchouli and a slight hint of amber. Terrible longevity only a few hours at best. Not much silage so close scent.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Can't believe that they realize this. It start with nice citruses kind of like Dior Cologne but after 30 minutes it become like washed down MB Explorer. 2.5/5
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is a pure lemon bomb, smells like you took Versace Eros EDT and just started pouring lemon perfume oil and didn't stop. Like it specifically smells like lemon candy.Lemonheads melted inside a lemonade.Not a fan. Anyone that says it smells like Aventus is nuts, they share citrus notes and that is it. May as well say anything with lemon is an Aventus clone at that point."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Cedrat Boise with the opening lemon notes from Fiero by Xerjoff, still has that Eros DNA underneath."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Lemon is a very popular scent in cleaners so it's an easy comparison for literally anything with lemon in it but this is a much more pleasant, candy-like lemon and not at all anything resembling the intensity of a cleaning product. That being said, it is very lemony for the first hour or so then calms down nicely and lets the other notes shine. The opening reminds me a bit of the opening of Y Eau Fraiche then it fades into an Aventus-y scent minus the smokiness. I would never guess this was an Eros as I don't get any of that DNA at all. Not a bad scent at all but if you already have CDNIM this might be redundant unless you just want something that's ever so slightly fresher."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Its OK, it smells like aventus cologne but not as woody and sharp, which is good in my book. The aventus DNA isn't for me. The opening smells like a lemon drop candy. Maybe to some it's going to smell like lemon Pledge. Heavily reminiscent of CDNIM in the opening. Then the dry down is another riff on an aventus clone drydown. Boring, but I guess it's better than explorer if you want an aventus clone.If you want a cheaper alternative to aventus cologne get this. I think it might even be more mass appealing than aventus cologne."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Smells just like lemon wars heads mixed with pledge cleaner, I can see the adventus comparisons, but linear and far less depth. Does it smell nice? yes and no, a bit synthetic, fresh, energy drink vibe. I think mont blanc explorer platinum is far superior, will be selling my bottle!"

That’s all it is. It will be popular, it smells good; I was hoping for some actual Eros DNA in this but there is none. It’s just a brand new fragrance from Versace that is in reality little more than a clone. Versace is just trying to sell an Aventus clone using one of their established brands as an excuse. This trend is getting pretty old"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Starts off like a lemon flavored gummy bear, slowly turns into an explorer like dry down, if you like yellow sweet candy with ambroxan from other ero's scents, and you would like a lighter version of explorer this might be for you.One thing I'm not sure about is the lemon might have the smell of dish soap, people might just think you just did the dishes or something. my rating 6.5/10.It's not bad but I don't love it either.Edit, there's a sharp citrus note that stays into the dry down that smells like light blue Italian love, which some people say smells like bo."

Lots of lemon, but very much like a bowl of sweet candy lemon, like lemonheads. That drops away pretty quick and right into the Aventus DNA. Over all a great designer take on the Aventus style. I got a pre-order for the 26th and it came with 3 10ml travel sprays of eros, eau fraiche, and dylan blue I believe. Definitely a solid designer frag, just late for summer 😂."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is Aventus Cologne(!) 1/1 I LOVE it! Don't listen to anyone saying it is like regular Aventus or CDNIM.First when I sprayed it tho, I was too like, oh, not another Aventus clone.But as the time passed by, in the drydown all the sweetness and lemonnes disapeared. It started smelling 1/1 like Aventus Cologne.And this is great news, since there were no clones of it. Yes, there was Insurection II, but it lasted 30 minutes, and its now discontinued.For a reasonable price now you can have Aventus Cologne. My rating is 10/10."

Dry down is slightly muskier and different but still lots of Explorer. I was expecting something Tygar or even Elysium like.I haven't wore it fully but at this point think that having Montblanc Explorer and Eros Energy makes no sense.Looking forward to try it properly.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"for the start, it smells 99% like the good old eau de rochas homme (released some 26 years before the aventus cologne, you're welcome..)but i do not dislike this release by versace. while it's really not very original, it's bold, understated, fresh, masculine, a bit oldschool (perfumes from the 90's are considered as old, right?) and the bottle is gorgeous.so if you have all your caramel/sugar/honey/sweetminty 2024 tiktoky cold weather releases + all trendy arab clones already, get this one to. because you don't wanna smell like santa claus the whole year, do you?and i like what caylemoore56 wrote below."

I think this is a great fragrance but some people might not like it if they do not like citrus. To all my citrus lovers out there o think its a great fragrance.

I love the review below me now)You’re full of sh*t. Everyone knows you’re full of sh*t and you’re well aware of it too.To say something lasts less than an hour is just stupid.This is a very typical Versace release.It’s an EXTREMELY citrusy opening. I say opening but it’s pretty much a what you spray is what you get linear fragrance that doesn’t fade much from the beginning.It’s a compliment magnet and I still smell it the next day on both my body and clothes.Like I said, it’s typical designer stuff. At least sample it. $115 for the big bottle at Macys. $75 for the small one.I was pleasantly surprised. You might be too.PS. Great review caylemoore56. Spot on."

What do you get out of such childlike behavior? I guarantee you the people over at Versace could care less...Doesn't effect them in the slightest. This fragrance will sell, and they're going to keep pumping out seller after seller, regardless of your ""handy work"" so my question is WHY?If you're under the age of 30 and you're doing this...It's time grow up. If you're over the age of 30 and you're doing this, I truly pity the fact that your life sucks so bad, that the way you get your kicks is by downvoting and comparing something you don't like to something totally unrelated and stupid. Some of us actually want to learn and know about new releases and legitimately what others have to say.As for my opinion on Versace Eros Energy? It's a lemony Aventus Cologne style fragrance, as others have stated. Lasts a good 6hrs or so on my skin and projects at an arms length for the majority of time...If that is your vibe, go for it! May have some redundancy if you own Aventus, CDNI or Explorer, but i enjoy it...Will eventually be a cheapie gem once it shows up at rack stores and online discounters."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Well, as advertised from color and name. This opening is pure citrus. Very much like a modern Clinique happy clone, hence I like it.I can bet that this is not lasting long. It dries to aventus light - a good summer version of Aventus which Creed should have released.I feel honestly like this is great (as any pure citrus is) but they certainly overpriced it.Also, they just use the Eros name to sell this citrus. No relation whatsoever, which I hate personally. They could have done a creative release for this.I'm not impressed with this despite liking it. Perfect for office or casual summer day of you want a uplifting fresh citrus frag that do not offend.But for the Versace brand this was zero balls, zero integrity. They usually take great risks and is one of my favorite frag brands. Just look at how bold Eros was in the game. And now this..EDIT: I was wrong it lasts, but the dry drown is horrible! The citrus is gone and you get the musky odour of a guy who wears Armaf Club de unit intense and danced energetically to dawn and came home dehydrated from ecstasy and is sweating the poison out."

Like the lemon and bergamot are very very noticeable. It does immediately remind me of aventus, however, it’s a cleaner, more shower gel like scent. I do enjoy this scent profile. The dry down though is literally monte blanc explorer, with a touch of lemon. In the past I have owned some Eros and the one thing I could say about them is that they are freaking nuclear. Sillage for days. This is not that. 4 sprays and two hrs later, it’s pretty darn close to the skin which is pretty disappointing. I’d give the actual scent a 9/10 but because it doesn’t last for crap, I can’t rate this extremely high but that to me is the only thing that is left to be desired."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The misunderstanding of this being compared to Aventus I guess is because many compare it to clones of Aventus they own, and they think it's more cool mentioning Creed. It does not smell like Aventus but I have an inspiration of it called Canyon Escape by Hollister that is somehow similar to this. Light, fresh, citrusy. An Aventus for teens someone described it. But Versace is stronger and better, and it costs 10 times as much though. Despite being a like Flame and the original are still better to me. My final advice, mark up the ones saying this is an Aventus clone and stop reading their reviews that will just make you throw money down the drain."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Eros Energy opens with a fizzy burst of citrus, reminiscent of a juicy mix of lime, lemon, and orange. It offers a lively, refreshing start very similar to Aaron Terence Hughes’ Supernova but lacks the salty ambergris found in Supernova. The dry down is simpler yet nuanced, featuring a touch of oakmoss, pink pepper, and patchouli, alongside a generous amount of white amber. This white amber reminds me of a mix of clean musks, sandalwood, and white woods, resulting in a smooth, refined finish with a clean woody profile. I don’t understand the comparison between Eros Energy and Creed Aventus though, as Aventus is well known for its peppery and leathery notes and smoky birch, which are quite different from Eros Energy’s very citrus-heavy and clean woody profile.As I mentioned in my first impressions review, Eros Energy is very, very similar to ATH's Supernova. If you already own Supernova, you might not need this one, and vice versa.Overall score: 8.5/10 , the opening is beautifully juicy and effervescent, while the dry down presents a very simple, clean woody scent—perfect for warm or even hot sunny days"

The thing is, it just smells like the average cologne: I don't know how to explain it, maybe it's the prominent citrus/bergamot 99% of men's freshies have as a note? OG Eros and Eros Flame are more unique and engaging, with added sweetness and spices."

It’s basically CDNI without the smoke. If you have CDNI and want a day time cologne then this is it. Compared to Mont Blanc Explorer, it’s basically that plus a ton of condensed citrus. I would get this over Explorer and CDNI but probably not over Aventus Cologne. However, I would probably need to test this with Aventus Cologne to get a better idea of which one I like better.

This smells like those lemon head candies or any other type of lemon candy for about 5 minutes and then immediately you get the Creed Aventus/Montblanc Explorer/Club de Nuit dry down, but in my opinion it doesn't smell as high quality as either of those. I love Versace but this is a disappointment. A major let down.Edit: This has a more smoothed out dry down. A semi-sweet, semi-creamy dry down. Not really vanillic, but you get a tad bit of fruitiness with a little bit of a lotion/soapy scent. Still not worth it because by the time it gets to this point in the dry-down you can't even smell it anymore; I have to sniff my hand where I sprayed it in order to smell this and it's only been about 5 hours. Weak projection, minimal sillage. Lemonhead opening, Aventus mid, semi fruity creamy dry down that is undetectable.5/10 for me. If this eventually gets discounted to like $40-$50 then maybe it'll be worth it."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Very lemony and the dry down reminds me of TDH Eau tres fraische a bit.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Whoever says this is a Aventus clone is saying BS...This is smells exactly like Eros Flame opening, throught the mid and the drydown.So basically they took Flame opening and make a whole fragrance about it. Very Citrusy, LemonyThey just removed the vanilla, tonka bean and sandalwood note from the scent and stay linear citrusy and musky scent.So if you missing the Flame opening that's fades away in time, this is for you."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This smells nothing like Aventus. The people that say it does are either just saying that to follow the sheep or they don't own Aventus.Aventus is pineapple with cedar and musk.Energy is lemon and citrus all the way through down to a sprinkle of wood in the background.It's nothing like Terre De Hermes either. Perseus by PDM is more like TDH.This is a great fragrance, fresh and playful and the ladies like it.Good performance for a freshie.A thumbs up from me 👍"

It does not smell like Aventus and is actually much easier to wear. For what it is and the price, and especially the eventual prices on discounters fragrance is an 8/10 for me"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Sampled this on my arm today. And since there is so much Aventus talk around this, I sprayed Mont Blanc Explorer on the other arm.Off the top, lots of citrus, bright and zesty. Then there is some herbaceous/green notes that come out in the mid. So far, so good. It’s the dry down …like 1-2 hours later where the Aventus vibe shows itself. Compared to the MBE…if that is a half brother to Aventus, VEE is a 2nd cousin. It doesn’t get as close as MBE, but the familiarity is there. I’ve never smelled Aventus Cologne, so maybe there is a closer similarity to that? I would say, if you are someone that has tired of Aventus and all branches of its family tree, you probably should take a pass here. It started out great…but then I felt like I was part of a bait-and-switch. Try for yourself."

Was hoping for something really citrusy, uplifting and interesting, but got Aventus Cologne. It’s a pleasant fragrance, but that DNA is played out.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Aventus has forever left its mark on the frag community. God damn that scent...Yet another Aventus inspiration...
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This smells awesome to me. Absolute lemon bomb opening, but in the best possible way. It's so good, I couldn't stop smelling my arm. In the drydown I don't know how it's supposed to be an aventus clone because it still smells like lemon, just much less intense with some woody and amber notes to round it out.I'm kind of glad it doesn't have the vanilla of eros, and I say this as someone who loves vanilla, as I think it would dilute the freshness. It is a bit weird to call it an eros flanker when it doesn't have much at all in common with eros or flame though. If you ignore the name and just enjoy it for what it is, which is delicious lemons, it's great.Sillage seems lower than flame and it faded to a skin scent after about 6 hours, but it stayed on my skin until I showered. That said, definitely possible it was projecting longer but I just stopped noticing."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Very different from the Blue Eros collection and Eros Flame. It's closer to Dior Homme Cologne and Jimmy Choo Man Ice in my opinion.So I think everyone can agree that this is a citrus bomb; absolutely spectacular combination but it's the lemon that stands out. And it dries down to a clean musk.I've never tried Aventus so can't compare but I have owned Explorer and this is better; but again they are similar.Longevity is excellent and a good compliment getter. But in reality if you have any of the comparative fragrances mentioned above this will be redundant.But that said, it is excellent and what I like.8/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It start off like a Lemon/Citrus bomb and slowly turns into a cheap, less complex Aventus clone. Extremely disappointed since it genuinely smells like a cheap Aventus clone you can find for 5€. The longevity and projection is amazing but I wouldn't want to smell like this so it doesn't save it. Go get Cedrat Boise intense or Aventus if you want a much better alternative"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The opening is really nice and attention grabbing - a citrus explosion. As it dries down it basically starts to become an Aventus clone, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's a tried and tested DNA that most people like (I'd recommend Aaron Terence Hughes Supernova if you want the best thing in this ballpark, though). After about 3-4 hours it has dried to a pretty generic, woody fragrance with a hint of citrus still there - it doesn't really smell like Aventus anymore at this point, it's more in the vain of the likes of DHS 2021 at this point. A decent enough release, but has no right to have the Eros name as there are zero similarities, and the only standout part is the short lived opening - though the rest is nice. I think it will have plenty of fans."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"To me this is a lemon explosion. If you like lemon, then you will probably like this."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Wow you guys are brutal. Here’s the deal, it’s a very citrusy Aventus. Eros in name only, lacks the dna entirely. It’s a fantastic scent, especially for those who have never smelled the Aventus dna. However, there’s nothing new here, it completely lacks originality. If you already have some Aventus clone or “inspired by”, just layer it with a citrus scent you have in your collection (I chose Versace Pour Homme) then you are close enough, and this is redundant. I will eventually get a bottle when I run out of my current Aventusy clone juice, and this is available in the <$60 range from discounters. But anyone who says this doesn’t smell good, is exaggerating by a wide margin."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Smells exactly like a peeled orange then dries down to smelling like creed aventus.

Hugely disappointing.A relatively generic lemon bomb that lacks the Eros longevity. Lasted no more than an hour on me. This is Eros in name only, it's no flanker."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As others have said, very Aventus forward, the Amroxan in the dry down leaves it ending up similar to Jeremy’s Office fragrance. Very pleasant if not a little redundant"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Citronella candle with candied orange. There’s an Aventus Cologne air far away but this smells like fancy mosquito repellent.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Got to smell it in Sephora and it smells like a very light Club de Nuit Intense, not like Aventus. This is a lemon bomb, that's it, that's all this fragrance is. The name reflects the fragrance, it's nice, but it has nothing from Aventus's base, no leather, no smoky birch, no woods, there is nothing there, just a top and somewhat of a mid. It smells like a good cheapy, not like some high end male fragrance, what Aventus is."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Its alright. But is it worth spending 90 USD on this bottle? No.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Just lemon, smells like Cedrat Boise or a slightly better version of club de nuit intense man."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"to my noise it smelled nothing like aventus it smells like lemon disinfectant to me. I mean yeah sure I guess energizing is one way to describe it but it's an absolute lemon bomb and extremely disappointing, the opening I get lemon the dry down some more lemon with maybe a hint of musk. Any flanker of the og and flame are more worth it in my opinion"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I has a chance to try this at Dillards and this is nothing more than another Aventus Bandwagon. It is not a 100% clone (tweak notes) , but it is close enough to think it is. If you have an Aventus or something similar, there is no need to get this. Having said that, the quality is very good and it would be a worthwhile purchase once it hits discounters. Interesting to see Versace go this route with some Aventus-like scents out in the market. Even Montblanc Explorer, which is similar enough, can be had for $40."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I actually love this. I’m not a fan of ‘blue’ fragrances so generally ignore them and look for more fruity juice for summer. This fits the bill brilliantly. The opening is all out citrus…..blood orange and grapefruit and I love it. After an hour the fragrance develops into a gorgeous pineapple scent, but not overly sweet. And I like that. I’m currently 5 hours into wearing it and it is still going relatively strongly on my skin and this is where the resemblance with Aventus kicks in. As it dries down it begins to smell somewhat like how Aventus opens….or more accurately how Club de nuit opens but not as raw and unrefined.For me as an all out summer fragrance it’s a big win."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Very pleasantly surprised after people saying it smelled like Aventus. It opens like a Chanel Allure and dries down smoothly. Only a small part of the dry down smells like Aventus or MB Explorer. I dig it !! This will be a great buy at discounters. Unfortunately the timing of the release couldn’t be much worse. It’s September and they dropped a citrus summer fragrance …. WOOPPSIE !!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"First and foremost I own a bottle of aventus and have owned many. This is not an aventus clone at all. Reminds me more of pdm perseus more than anything. This smells wonderful, and i'm glad I got this. Stand alone smells good and works very well on my skin. Way.Happy with my purchase.Considering the prices of everything nowadays."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Extremely underwhelming! Nothing unique about it, definitely will not be buying"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"If you see any people that says this is similar to Aventus, dont believe them. Its not similar at ALL.Super citrusy, smells like pure lemon all the way through.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Guys if u have any....... ANYYYYYYY Aventus clones at home. Dont buy this Fragrance. What the hell did Versace think to make this perfume. This is a straight up clone of Aventus. This is not even quality stuff, every arabian clone house brought the same juice out. The Opening is very lemony and has some Black currant stuff in like the clone of Dunhill desire Gold its juicy but again there are enough clones out there, then the worst the DRYDOWN, the drydown smells exactly like Club de nuit intense, like laventure, like montblanc, everybody who ever made a aventus clone. all those Fragrance influencer are tricking u to buy this stupid stuff. Please believe me when i say its a clone of all the other clones. Versace this is a very dissapointment stuff to not be creative but to clone a Fragrance who already was cloned by million arabian clone houses shame on u."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"opening is great lots of citrus notes but the dry down after an hour is rather disappointing nothing like any of the eros line the oakmoss, patchouli, and musk smells a little bit too ""earthy"" to me"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Disappointed but it’s still good. has the tiniest bit of Eros DNA but reeks of aventus.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Eros Energy: First 10min is nice realistic smell of fresh grated Zitron crust. After 5-10 min is added ginger smell. After 30 min little bit patchouli and musk is comming. Longevity and silage no so good. Nice bottle.If you want this type ""aventusy-explorery"" but in GINGER vein smell, go to the Abercrombie & Fitch - Authentic.Abercrombie & Fitch - Authentic has little bit better sillage and longevity, better price, and it is much better blend.Always I want to buy calming greeny-blue Eros bottle. Remind me ancient Greeks baths in God Of War game. But for me it is mess of sugar synthetic apple synthetic vanilla and synthetic mint.Eros Energy in yellow bottle is nice frag, but greeny-blue bottle is better in an aesthetic sense."

My expectations weren't that high I can't lie so I really wasn't expecting the feedback I received today. I was waiting on the elevator & this lovely lady came up telling me how tasty I was smelling lol. After work I headed out to a pool hall & some of my buddies were like ''dang bro u smelling fresh, what's that Aventus?''I just showed them the bottle & they didn't know about the new flanker. This doesn't smell like Aventus BUT it's like a long lost distant cousin...no smoky vibes, it dries down to a nice patchouli / oakmoss drydown-Ima be wearing the hell out of this!!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Is the Aventus ""DNA"" in the room with us? LMAOThere is not a shred of resemblance to Aventus or any ""Aventus-inspired"" fragrances. If it smelled just a little bit like it, I'd meet you in the middle and understand. But, wow! This is genuinely stretching it. Completely not the impression I got from spraying it. And I'm not even saying it is a nice fragrance. It was quite boring. If anything, this looks way more like Flame, but a ""more bright and juicy"" version. And flame was alright.It straight-up reminds me of those soluble grapefruit water syrup drinks you get after football practice as a kid. It's just musky citrus from start to finish.Regurgitated echo chamber vomit talk. I'm starting to think many people in this community just watch fragrance YouTube/TikTok all day and click Amazon affiliate links. ""Oh no, they're copying the greatest frag of all time again!"" Can we stop the BS already? There exists more than your 3-mosquito spray fragrance rotation of Club de Nuit and whatever. Get out of the parrot box and think for yourself!EDIT: Upon further investigation, I finally know what this smells like! CLEARLY, it is Dora the Explorer from Dora and Boots. Sorry, guys, I wish I picked up on it sooner!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"To anyone who bought this scent at full price—congratulations, you've been had. The comments I’ve come across are amusing; after 12 years, people still aren't tired of these Aventus-like fragrances. Versace must be laughing, knowing they can keep releasing uninspired scents, all thanks to your continued support. Yes, it's mass-appealing, but it's also unimaginative and brings nothing new to the table. Instead of backing smaller, innovative brands, you’re supporting the same old repetitive nonsense."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Really nice opening, mid brings out the aventus quality and then the drydown smells more like aventus cologne and I like it a lot. If you want something similar to aventus cologne then this is pretty good."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I bit disappointed to be honest. It smells a lot like club de nuit which I despise. The opening does smell better quality than CDN but it still strong. It gave me a compliment though. It doesn’t smell bad but it’s not what I expected.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Got a tester today, and I will get a bottle for sure. Definitely in the Aventus Cologne realm. If Aventus wasn't a thing yet, people would be losing their minds over this. It is not revolutionary, it has been done, but it is zesty and awesome smelling. Easy blind buy or summer dumb reach with quality and wearability. Seasonality is the same as Aventus. Not like Flame, and I love Flame too.This is a designer/cheaper alternative to super popular DNA's that has quality and mass appeal. Easy to test as it is in every store. Opening is a nice Lemon head's candy kind of start, then dries to the Aventus Cologne thing. If you like this DNA and don't already own something like it, great choice."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Smells just like the original Aventus in the opening, then turns into the cologne version in the dry down. Just a more affordable version of those two offerings. Good for the masses, not for me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Club de nuit intense with 150 edges of lemon.Not in a bad way, it's a good fragrance but yet again, another aventus variation, which for me is boring.Don't get me wrong: it is a beautiful fragrance, but if you own aventus and cedrat Boise, this will be a little redundant."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Had a chance today to try this in the store.2 sprays on a paper strip and it instantly hit me what it reminded me of: Supremacy Not Only Intense by Afnan.No, they are not exactly the same. The citruses are not that sharp and heavy in Eros Energy and it dries down to a less mossy, more musky and ambery base than SNOI. However they smell extremely similar for the first 1-2 hours, just like any Aventus inspired fragrance. Whoever says it doesn't have the characteristics of Aventus clones is lying big time or doesn't know what he's talking about. After that 1-2 hour period the differences show clearly.Despite SNOI being unpleasant for my nose in the first 30 minutes, I’d still buy that over Eros Energy. Mainly because of the price but also because Energy is a lighter scent overall.I didn’t expect this scent profile at all, I mean I knew it was a citrus-heavy fragrance but let’s just say it’s a strange flanker nonethless.SNOI costs €43 while Energy sits around €73 where I live. If you own anything with the legendary Aventus DNA, don’t buy this fragrance. You don’t need it then."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This is absolutely 100% a lemon BOMB. If you're not a citrus-lemon lover you will not like this fragrance because it is so lemon-dominant. Amazing fragrance. 9/10.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,why buy this instead of club de nuit is beyond me

Just a clumsy mess of citrus trying to be the new aventus. With so many annoying citrus releases in the last few years, this took that to the extreme for no reason. No relation to the og eros.Although it is isn't offensive to smell, it is not worth the price tag for a generic citrus fragrance.Opening is just sqeezing an orange zest on your skin, and everything after that is just more lemon.3/10"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Great cologne and finally something I like from the Eros line. Fresh and zesty opening and love the musk when it dries down and it stays with you all day unlike most fresh colognes that don’t usually last as long as you would like them to and yes it does remind a bit of Aventus but baccarat rouge? I don’t think so.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Kind of boring. I was expecting straight up lime/lemon based off reviews but its a generic “for men” perfume. With not the best longevity and projection

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Opening is a fresh and bitter citrusbomb, drydown is musky Club De Nuit / MB Explorer while retaining some hint of citrus.Smells good, better than MontBlanc Explorer and Club De Nuit, but like them it is nothing special.Matter of fact none of the Aventus dupes are anything special.Never tried Aventus itself on my skin (only the opening on paper), guess I don't want to at this point.Eros Energy is only worth buying if you have no other citrusy fragrances."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Gotta say this is exactly what I’d imagined it to be and better.I personally understand that the fragrance community is kind of bummed by the late release as summer is almost over, and I think that’s what makes people a bit sour about the release.To me it doesn’t smell like aventus, it just has a bit of the citruses in the base like aventus has…but to me it has a similar vibe like Creed neroli Sauvage, but a denser and sweeter version.Conclusion, uplifting and fresh naturally smelling citruses, not a room filler but just a nice scent bubble for 2/3 hours, then it fades to a skin scent.I think you can also wear this to work as it won’t offend anyone.Downside: wish it came before I tried every cheaper alternative to Neroli Sauvage :)Overall really happy with the freshness of this and I’m definitely going to rock this until fall!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Well well, what a surprise, and a good one. From the comments and some reviewers, I was expecting something dull, unoriginal, and overall not well done.So I give it to you guys, it is not original, but it is freaking well done. And would even go as far as saying one of the best designer release for this year 2024.The name says it all, although they could probably name it something else than Eros, because there's nothing really linking it to the line. But who cares really....It's energetic, absolutely positive vibes, the ingredients seem to be well above average. Compared to the release of Parfum de Marly Perseus for example, I would put Eros Energy above, easily.Perseus, Aventus, Hermes Eau Givrée, D&G light blue.... etc etc etc.... of course you'll find some resemblance to all of those grapefruit, citrusy fragrances. But I dont see it has a problem, since being completely original is damned difficult. What matters is ""does it smell good ?"". Answer, absolutely yes.And you will get compliments if that matters."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Very very average in my opinion. Citrus bomb. Honestly don't smell much else except maybe a little bit of sweetness from the musk and an aventus like sharpess the tiniest bit. 5.5/10

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Pretty nice scent. Does have aventus vibes.

They both clear Eros Energy in all aspects, these both smell and perform like older Creed batches. I don't really know what place this takes in the market as it doesn't really have a place with the market being oversaturated with this Dna. This will probably sell really well tho just like Mont Blanc explorer and sadly make the Dna more generic.Also if you're claiming that this is it's own thing and not a clone or a inspired by, then you're just pure delusional.Le Beau Paradise is still the best release of the year, atleast they didn't copy another popular fragrance."

Versace Eros energy. It smells amazing for what Versace is I don’t know about preformance but smells ok not masculine or anything like that this will definitely have bees after you nothing crazy in my opinion I’m sticking to flame.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"They really made a higher quality CDNIM and called it a day. It’s going to sell really good probably, too bad it’s the most unoriginal fragrance release in recent history imo. Literally just doing what the Arabic clone companies are doing, taking a popular fragrance dna and putting their little twist on it. Not a bad fragrance tho, if what you want is Aventus with way more citrus at the top then this is exactly what you’re looking for."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I wore this for the first time yesterday. It opens with a massive burst of citrus. It's extremely bright, lively and lives up to the ""Energy"" name. As it dries down, the aventus backbone really starts to shine through, with the classic moss, musk, and amber of the DNA progressively becoming more prominent as the citrus fades away.Overall the the scent profile is pleasant, if a bit unoriginal. Performance is disappointing, especially in a line like Eros known for performance. The longevity and projection are both.... meh. I'll say that other than the name and (quite beautiful) bottle, this has nothing to do with Eros. I'll probably pick it up at some point, but it's not a gamechanger."

All those citruses are listed to inform you that this is a citric bomb. And it is. Whereas Aventus is a bergamot overload that gives off a pineapple impression in the opening, this is straight-up fresh, juicy citruses, all of them that have ever grown on the face of this planet. The difference is stark. The dry-down, sadly, does bring Aventus to mind with that perfumey, musky middle-aged men sort of vibe. Pass.Edit: I can't stand that dry down, it gets progressively worse."

Surprised there's so many upvotes for aventus and aventus clones lol wtfAlso the yellow bottle is a complete giveaway that this was inspired by PDM perseus not even aventus. And it doesn't even smell like perseus either which has more of a terre d'hermes / sospiro basso scent"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,I just tried this for the first time today. It opens with a lemon blast. It comes across super synthetic. I beg to differ with some other reviewers here. I do not get a lot of projection. Also the fragrance does not change much. You get that lemon citrus that hangs around the whole time. The fragrance is very linear. I used 10 sprays on my shirt. It has a soft scent. I would say it is very safe for the office. Probably shines best on a 90 degree day. Overall I would rate it a 6.5 to a 7. It's a decent scent. It is 100% OVER HYPED. It is not a must have. If you have other citrus scents you do not need this. It is not so different that it justifies the purchase. I would say wait until it hits discounters. At that point it might be worth a pick up. Again it's decent not great!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Lemonhead / lemon halls Aventus. Waste/10.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I really like this one and bought a bottle. It's obviously in the same wheelhouse as Aventus (especially Aventus Cologne) and Explorer, but I actually like it a little bit better. Eros Energy's citrus is a little bit more candied, similar to something like Tygar. Musk is one of my favorite accords and one of the reasons I like Energy so much. It's more musky than the fragrances it's compared to, and the musk is done really well. The musk and oakmoss come out a lot more in the dry down. The oakmoss gives Energy an edge by providing some depth and character. I was expecting a fairly linear fragrance, but the musk and oakmoss really give it some layers and evolution throughout the wearing. I find the opening to be a mass pleasing, candied citric explosion, but the dry down is quite a bit more interesting, even a little bit funky, but I love it. I think the type of patchouli used contributes to this, as it's a little bit dark and earthy which I wasn't expecting. This is a fragrance you should definitely give a full wearing to before deciding on buying because of the way it develops on the skin throughout the hours.Speaking of hours, Energy has very strong performance. It lasts a long time and projects well. It's highly concentrated and quite oily on the skin. The box/bottle says 69.5% alcohol which means Energy is pretty highly concentrated, especially for an EDP."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This should have been Versace Pour Homme EdP. Has nothing to do with Eros line. It smells amazing and performance is good. Reminds me of Allure Homme Edition Blanche and Explorer.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Bought my bottle at a Polish Sephora. Name definitely represents the olfactive experience and feeling you get from the blast.Literally smells like Lemonheads candy mixed with a smoky oakmoss. Very fresh and invigorating but 1 dimensional.Not anything you must have in your collection, don't regret my purchase however. 7/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Such a disappointed its just a citrus smell that later on turns in to something similar to club de nuit intense but with less depth and character longevity and projection are also terrible after 3-4hrs i could barely smell it
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Come on man. Why?I love Eros Flame, with a passion. I like Eros, it's pretty good. Eros Parfum, is great! This is not like those in a number of ways that are very disappointing to me. It isn't a bad fragrance, but being in this line makes it very disappointing.You come to Eros for that Vanilla and Mint and that work together so incredibly well. Why put a weird combination of Aventus and a somewhat generic fresh fragrance in an Eros bottle? I mean we have so many ""Aventus Style"" fragrances, and this isn't super close which is to it's benefit. It seems roughly inspired, I think any attempt to call it a clone is a stretch.Did the perfumer making this have a lemon fetish? Lemon in the opening, lemon in the drydown, the bottle is NEON YELLOW. I mean, this has nothing to do with Eros, they might as well have slapped it in a lemon shaped bottle too but the perfumer would have probably got so excited they'd stroke out.In the words of a loving, but stern father. I'm not angry, just disappointed. This reminds me of when Azzaro Wanted released Wanted Tonic. At least this has some character in the absurd lemon obsession. The time this is released is also funny, right as summer comes to an end they release the yellow beast to beat us down as the cold descends upon us.This is like a cover band with a bassist from the original band. You buy this because it's eros, and not because it Versace Lemon Lover. It's wearing the face of good fragrances to sell you lemon. If you love lemon I am sure you are offended, and for that I apologize. I assure you that you can bathe in this when it shows up on eBay and TJMax and Marshalls in a few months.Why, oh why?Update: 9-17-24I'm still not a fan. It's not horrible, but I still feel like it's not great. I feel pretty much the same. I don't shame you if you really like this, it's not horrible, just very disappointed.If this was a song it'd be Troublemaker by Green Day. Come on, you know why. Used to be a good line with good releases, and then they come out with hot garbage."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Eros EDT was the first fragrance I ever fell in love with and got me addicted to fragrance collecting, for many years it was unrivalled and never smelled anything better than it. And I speak on behalf on eros lovers out there, but this is quite offensive and disrespectful what they have done here. This smells terrible, citrusy toilet spray smelling mess.... Us eros fans have been asking for original eros dna with some iris in it or coffee in it for ages and they give us this disaster.. If you want to make eros fresh here's my advice, amplify the mint and turn it into a Gin & Tonic type of smell and keep the vanilla/tonka sweetness. The lime would only work if you keep the mint from the original eros and maybe add some juniper too"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Got a bottle from the Fragrance Shop in the UK. Definitely Versace's version of Aventus. I prefer it to flame but not as good as the original blue bottle. Its nothing unique at all but the first day wearing it I got complimented on it by several female friends. So nothing that will impress someone seriously interested in fragrances but will do a good job for a guy looking to smell nice for the girls

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Versace/Eros-Energy-92647.html,Eros Energy Versace cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As others have said, this is pretty similar to Aventus. The citrus, pepper, currant, and base notes all combine to create something that's akin to Aventus but without the leathery smoky notes or the birch. The opening to me is more like a lemon zest than lemon juice and the dry down leans heavily on the musk and moss but retains that zest scent the whole time as well. The notes themselves are high quality and smell authentic though, which is the strong point of this fragrance.Energy isn't even remotely close to the DNA of either Eros or Eros Flame, and as far as flankers go this may as well not even be considered one outside of the bottle.At the end of the day this still isn't a bad scent by any means but it's just too familiar. If you don't have Aventus then this may be a decent buy as it's pretty much $250 less but if you do it is simply a redundant purchase."

What do you get out of such childlike behavior? I guarantee you the people over at Versace could care less...Doesn't effect them in the slightest. This fragrance will sell, and they're going to keep pumping out seller after seller, regardless of your ""handy work"" so my question is WHY?If you're under the age of 30 and you're doing this...It's time grow up. If you're over the age of 30 and you're doing this, I truly pity the fact that your life sucks so bad, that the way you get your kicks is by downvoting and comparing something you don't like to something totally unrelated and stupid. Some of us actually want to learn and know about new releases and legitimately what others have to say.As for my opinion on Versace Eros Energy? It's a lemony Aventus Cologne style fragrance, as others have stated. Lasts a good 6hrs or so on my skin and projects at an arms length for the majority of time...If that is your vibe, go for it! May have some redundancy if you own Aventus, CDNI or Explorer, but i enjoy it...Will eventually be a cheapie gem once it shows up at rack stores and online discounters."

It smells like a nice citrus fuzzy shower gel.

But it shares more similarities with Eros flame than the original but it isn’t redundant to own both that’s for sure.88 euros for 100ml.A very good pickup for an all year scent !"

I'll try to give a useful review.It is VERY strong, and straight-down-the-line mainstream, so if those things are your 'zone,' I think you will really love this. It lives up entirely to the 'elixir' trend - it's almost as strong as Sauvage Elixir and Pasha Parfum (not quite, but almost).It opens with an element of lavender, but this quickly moves into the background, as 'dense aromachem' takes over. It is very sweet, so if you like sweet scents, you may love this. There isn't really any further play or development in the scent. I mean, is there a dab of leather? Is there a dab of ethyl maltol? Is there a vanilla aromachem?Maybe, but...This scent really doesn't lend itself to that sort of analysis. Ultimately, it's totally on trend, so if you like 1 Million, or Sauvage Elixir, or Pasha Parfum, or Invictus Victory Elixir, or... or... or..., then you'll love this."

Musky vanilla dry down with a fruity opening

Has an accord that is close to maninka, but isn't quite the same.From a sillage perspective, this thing is a powerhouse. I spritzed this on some paper and put it in a room with decent airflow. You could definitely smell this walking by the room for several hours. I did the same experiment with Boss Bottled Elixir and it wasn't as noticeable.Forget the haters in this thread.

When first sprayed you can tell there’s lavender but it’s definitely overpowered by the spicyness but not in a bad way. I’ve seen people comment saying it’s fruity and I kinda get where they’re coming from with the dry down; it’s odd but nice. Nothing original but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good scent which is what lots of people mix up in these reviews. Every friend I’ve showed the cologne to really likes it which means if you want to appeal to other people this will. Overall it’s spicy before dry down with a bit of lavender, and sweet like berries (MAYBE cranberry) with a powdery feel after which will last.Go test it for yourself at Sephora or something, don’t trust these reviews hating just to hate (aka Djani_V)"

Now after testing it in hot weather it makes much more sense to me, as the fruity character combines better with higher temperatures, making it more radiant and attractive. For me is a very good summer scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Hugo-Boss/Boss-The-Scent-Elixir-For-Him-88879.html,Boss The Scent Elixir For Him Hugo Boss cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is, in my opinion, what the spicebomb infrared lineup WISHES it was. This is great stuff! Potent, long lasting and it smells fantastic. It is unmistakably a 'Boss The Scent' flanker, and I could swear there is maninka in this despite the note breakdown not listing it. Either way, it does bear a similarity to Magnetic, but I also find it reminiscent to 1M Royal. I'm wearing it on a warm, humid day, transitioning from the A/C to outside and back. It is not cloying at all. I do think this shines more in cooler weather, but it works well in moderate heat and humidity if you don't overspray. It is peppery, lavender-y, and the sandalwood gives it this smooth, dusty, almost powdery drydown that is absolutely fantastic. That's the most important part, IMHO, since that's what you smell the most anyway. Come for the opening, enjoy the mid, and stay for the (long lasting) drydown. This stuff rocks.Edit: Wearing this today, two sprays. Insane performance. This is one truly great all-around performer. And it just smells freakin' awesome. There's a tart 'fruitiness' to the spice in the mid that is just awesome. But this and other Hugo Boss offerings will never top anyone's youtube lists because they aren't 'hyped'. They'd rather complain about the poor performance of their chanels or versaces. lol. I love this stuff. TRUE beastmode, this one."

Syrupy, fruity, peppery and highly addictive - this is the quintessential clubbing fragrance for men (and I’m so glad I blind bought it). Boss The Scent Elixir For Him “remotely” reminds me of the spices in both Azzaro Pour Homme Elixir (2009) and the original Black XS (2005). I can also detect a hint of Ultra Male (2015), especially in the dry down. Be mindful of too many sprays though: we’re talking BEAST MODE here, so - yes - it can get unbearably sweet.Rating: 10/10"

My expectations were not high, but I thought that since it was an elixir and it has a spicy pepper top note it might be a little more interesting than the Hugo Boss average. It's not.It smells exactly like ""generic Boss sauce"". It reminds me of cheap Mac Baren pipe tobaccos that all contain this generic ""aromatic tobacco"" flavoring. Here it's basically WOODS, BRO! + LAVENDER, BRO! + GENERIC SPICE, BRO!It's not disgusting, the performance is strong (as it should be, being an elixir), it's just really boring, and not in an ""unexciting but sophisticated"" way."

The quality is good, the composition is not too monotonous, something is happening here. I thought I would like it, but I don't like this perfume at all. Maybe it's not so much that I don't like them, but that they didn't make any impression on me. The Scent Elixir is, in my opinion, too boring and derivative, there are at least a few mainstream titles in a similar vein and this composition doesn't really stand out compared to them. It's just there and it smells, but without much charm. Something irritates me here, maybe it's the lack of originality.Longevity and projection are good, but there are Elixirs with higher power. The price is way too high for now. I appreciate the really good quality, but I don't even want to write about the composition. It's not a bad perfume, but it doesn't convince me to spend more money on it. Even when the dust from the newness tax settles and the value of other Bosses comes down to the same level, I won't chase the bottle. Boredom.7/10"

Opens with smooth, fizzy, modern vanilla, fresh lavender and a warm spicy kick. Maintains the creaminess for quite a while but becomes woody and dry as it dries down.It's not completely unique, as there are many modern fragrances that have this particular vanilla note, but it's done in a more mature way than most, has nice development, and it's really addictive.I think that it's actually closer to Gentlemen Society than to most of the ""reminds me of"" section here, with how it opens sweet and creamy and turns into something mostly woody."

I would replace the fresh spicy with the warm spicy in the main accords... it's more of a smooth, cooling fragrance than being a warm, dark spicy... the quality is good, and it's suitable for cold weather, fall, or winter.Performance wise... It's very strong and projects very well... lasted all day on my skin, and two sprays on a paper strip were projecting for 6+ hours, 1 meter away from my side table... the performance is very good 8.5/10.All in all 7/10 (personal opinion) I think it's overwhelming and boring...

I see myself wearing it 3 or 4 times a year MAX I guess... it's good quality with good performance 👍but I suggest testing it 👍"

To me this is in a league of its own I can not compare it to any perfume I own or here on the remind me ofs on Fragrantica. To me this smells sweet hot peppery with little lavender and nice sandalwood that stays throughout to the excellent end.Boss Bottled Elixir was a 10/10 for me and this one Boss The Scent Elixir 🙌 is also a 10/10 for me in my humble opinion. I paid $119 for this and very well worth it. It smells like nothing eles I have in my collection. This hot sweet spicy smokey resinous Elixir is a sweet addition to my collection 😍. For those hesitant to buy this and say it's mainstream and smells like all the other spicy mens perfumes out there do not know what they are missing you need to get a tester or blind buy it and take a chance or wait for it to hit discounters someday.........later next year if you are lucky. Let's just say I have this Boss Bottled Elixir and The Scent Elixir and I'm glad I snagged them both and they are back up bottle worthy the both of them. Hope this helps but you need to buy let's be honest lol ttfn.

The airy pepper adds mystery as it follows you. The closer you get it gets sweeter and juicier and some other fixative present like lemony elemi resin adding the juicy woody sweetness mixing with the lavender. As it dries, the red pepper just pops more and more. Does not have ambroxan overload that I can detect in other elixirs. So, overall, the pepper gives a classy elegant airiness, but up close is sexual and sticky sweet."

Boss Bottled Elixir is excellent as is this and I now own both.This is spicy, sweet, savoury and leathery with a bit of cinnamon and vanilla. I get a touch of tea in the drydown which I love. Some patchouli but more spicy. Reminds me a bit of JPG Le Male Elixir from a weight/ heaviness perspective.

The more I wore it the more I appreciated it. It's warm spicy fruity and the perfect amount of woody . It's smooth and velvety. At first you get a red pepper , fruity sweet scent . As the lavender comes on it does start getting a little powdery. I getground cinnamon tossed in powder out of it with some slight sweetness. Once it has totally dried and settles on to the skin the sandalwood comes in so smooth and almost creamy . Once you get to that stage you get the red pepper back . You get light freshly chopped red pepper with a mellow lavender all riding the very smooth sandalwood with a warm sweetness all around . It almost smells like the sweetness is coming out of the sandalwood. I like how this fragrance slowly matures . Most fragrances in like 20 minutes you smell every layer. This one is going to give you about 4 layers in like an hour. It might be a little linear but it sooo works for this. This stuff is strong ! 3 sprays is enough with this. With 3 sprays all on my skin I was able to catch whiffs of this easily 4 hours later . At about 6 hours could still smell that it's there. It doesn't turn into something you need to smash your nose into until about 9 hours later . Good sillage , a good 5 or 6 feet. It will project strong for the first 2 hours . It is a very versatile evening fragrance as far as occasion. Season, I just wouldn't wear it on a hot night . But it works for just about any season but summer. It would also work on a cold winter day . Just be careful with how much you apply. The bottle is heavy and feels very well made , the atomizer is solid as well.Scent - 9.0Complexity - 7.0Quality - 8.5Performance - 10.0Bottle - 9.0"

So if you like those fragrances you should like this one as well.I also get a little of the Boss Magnetic and Stronger with you DNA sprinkled in.Its a fairly sweet fragrance. The lavender and powdery notes are more present in the dry down.All in all, not a bad release.6/10 - Nice.UPDATE: 8/10 - This is starting to grow on me more. I actually prefer it over the 1 Million it reminds me of. The opening is GREAT, I just wish it kept that scent from beginning to end, because the dry down is not as good as the opening. Will need to do more testing."

Maybe not in extreme heat. Not super unique, but have received compliments the two times I have worn it, and its growing on me each time. May be a love eventually. Awfully pricey, but it feels so right as a signature scent. Maninka fades off the top pretty quickly, but still at a background hum through the 6 hours mark. I don't pick up the heat others get, but I notice something peppery. Very smooth in my humble opinion and if you don't have Eros Flame and can afford it, I recommend. I've only done 1-2 sprays each wearing and never failed to pick it up in the air all day and evening. The lavender really pops throughout for me, I feel like the peppery element really shines in bringing out the lavender. It's soothing AND sexy. My 50ml bottle didn't have a magnetic cap which I'm slightly bummed about considering the asking price. BOSS having a decent 2024. Bottled Elixir was a banger as well. 09/10"

For me and my friends it smells like a fresh, slightly sweet, leathery fraganace. The mix of sandalwood, lavender, and spice create a very masculine fresh and leathery type fragance. TBH you can't smell the individual notes until a few wears. So most people would only be able to smell the leather and sweetness. So another person smelling this would enjoy this on a man very safe and likeable DNA, but it's unique enough to stand out. Overall, I really enjoy this scent as a everyday type of wear if your debating on buying it I would say it is worth it if your looking for a everyday wear that people will notice and appreciate."

The Scent Elixir has the same dna of the original The Scent but made spicier, deeper and with an hint of Stronger With You EDT, extremely addicting. The fruity maninka sweetness is definitely present, don't know why is not listed. All the fragrances from this line are all pretty similar to each other just with small tweaks and The Scent Elixir is not an exepction. Positive thing of this Elixir flanker? Stronger and slightly more mature compared to the others from this line. This lasts and projects a lot, could easily smell on me after 12 hours.

Quite feminine, the more i put my nose to my arm the more im growing on it. it starts out quite manly with the sandalwood covering all the notes, but dies down to this sweet little candy hinting a fun little spicy chili behind it."

Now having sampled it, I’ve learned (again) YouTube sucks. The Scent Elixir hits me like the general atmosphere of the mens fragrance section at Sephora. If you told me this was a new 1 Million or Most Wanted or Spicebomb, or pretty much anything of that ilk, I’d believe it hook, line and sinker.Not to say The Scent’s Elixir is without its merits. Chili peppers bring a noticeable spark to the opening and really allow you to feel some heat. In a sense, this is what I expected from the Infrared Spicebombs. Less cinnamon candy and more intense heat. Lavender also shines through that is intermittently both sweet and floral. It’s a really nice contrast with the heat. There’s also a slightly fruity dustiness that makes for a drier fragrance and ups the masculinity.Sadly, these only last a short time before this Elixir dries down to what I can only describe as “Sephora Musk” mixed with that lingering dryness and some fairly resinous woods. It’s not the most natural combination and grows cloyingly synthetic. For better or worse, this elixir does not seem to have monster projection, so you may be left peacefully alone."

The only thing it has going for it is that it's an upgrade from Scent For Him Magnetic. The smell is almost identical except this fragrance starts off with a slightly deeper spicy/sweet vib. After several hours, it has that vanilla vib just like the way Magnetic starts off with.I totally agree and why there's so many giving this cologne a poor rating.It's overpriced, nothing that WOW's you and it's worth the money Coty wants you to buy it for. Another money grab. Once Coty, understands that people are not spending their money on expenses non-niche cologne. Unless they start producing a cologne/purfume that's worth buying, I hope everyone realizes that you're paying for a substandard fragrances."

Maybe some very slight leather notes?Some musk and tonka apparent also.Then a pleasant dry and woody base. Patchouli is there too.Smells nicer in the air than off the skin.Suits men ages 20+. Spring, autumn and winter. Day or night. Not office safe IMO.Performance is good; fairly decent projection first couple of hours, longevity as a skin scent is 8hrs+.It's not really close to the original. Still prefer the original and ""Private Accord.""The 3 note breakdown is unhelpful and inaccurate. Also don't agree with the ""Reminds Me Of"" section. At times (within the first hour) it reminded me of ""Joop Homme.""Was excited to try this as I love the orginal ""Boss The Scent."" I feel it might be bad timing for this one as the market is inundated with elixir's right now. ""Boss Bottled Elixir"" feels easier to like, almost as if they put more effort into that one and put this together in a hurry as an after-thought?

I feel like this is a fragrance that fragrantica doesn’t do justice. The notes irl that I smelt are different than what it says on fragrantica. I do not like overly “warm” spicy fragrances like jaipur homme or dior sauvage elixir but this is a different kind of warm. It’s gentle, sweet and to my surprise almost vanillic. It’s a really good, sweet, masculine, spicy and somehow fresh scent. I feel like this could be worn on a summer night. To all the people who say this isn’t youthful, I’m 19 and my gf is 18 and we both loved it.

Parfum is the highest concentration which is what ALL Elixir's tend to be... Dior Sauvage Elixir started the Elixir trend off, which is a Parfum concentration, not a special Elixir concentration (because it doesn't exist. It's the SAME thing as a Parfum)... What Dior Sauvage Elixir does differently is mix up the existing line by making a niche turn for the fragrance. It did it so well, all other designers jumped on the trend to cash in a slice of the pie just like everyone did with blue fragrances on the back of Bleu de Chanel.Now, about Boss The Scent Elixir, it DOES have maninka fruit in. Designers are now getting more basic in provided notes but this has maninka and vanilla in 100% I can detect it.This fragrance is alike to Boss The Scent Magnetic but is a slightly less sweet and a tad more spicy and aromatic version of it.It's warm and sweet but not too spicy, just enough to balance out the sweetness.This isn't a playful scent, definitely not one catered to the youth. It's a mature fragrance most suited to the 30+ demographics. The pepper is prominent, but not in your face.I'd give it a solid 8/10 rating, it's not worth £100+ for 100ml. Accurate pricing I'd say £70-80 for 100ml.I would say it's a cold weather fragrance, day or night, it doesn't matter. Day or night, winter or fall, spring or summer, it's complete marketing nonsense for something to be summer only but not spring, or day only but not night... Just like it's nonsense for feminine or masculine (fragrances are unisex), and Elixir Extrait Parfum Intense (they all represent the SAME concentration)..."

It opens with a smoky, aromatic-spicy and woody fragrance for men.- The Scent Elixir starts with a piercing spicy scent that is mixed will with the sweetness coming from the Lavender Note.- The mid and dry down smells very Smoky, Woody and Spicy-Aromatic.- I sprayed a total of 5 times. Twice behind each ear, twice on the front of neck, and once in front of my chest. The projection and longevity is amazing, it lasts approximately 8-12 hours on my skin, and projects for about 30-45 minutes before turning into a skin scent. (Depends on skin types)Overall Rating (9/10)- The Scent Elixir is a unique release. Although the price is quite high, it is an Elixir Parfum Intense with a very unique spicy scent coming form Hugo Boss.

I thought as I like the line it would be a safe buy and luckily it was. Its got a nice spicy freshness to it off the top with a nice aromatic touch. It kinda reminds me of magnetic and le parfum put together. It's nice I like it a lot. It projects very well aswell so for me this is a very good release. It's definitely different compared to the original. Can't really smell the lavender which is good personally for me. I think it's got vanilla in there and possibly iris.

Syrupy, fruity, peppery and highly addictive - this is the quintessential clubbing fragrance for men (and I’m so glad I blind bought it). Boss The Scent Elixir For Him “remotely” reminds me of the spices in both Azzaro Pour Homme Elixir (2009) and the original Black XS (2005). I can also detect a hint of Ultra Male (2015), especially in the dry down. Be mindful of too many sprays though: we’re talking BEAST MODE here, so - yes - it can get unbearably sweet.Rating: 10/10"

Nothing original but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good scent which is what lots of people mix up in these reviews. Every friend I’ve showed the cologne to really likes it which means if you want to appeal to other people this will. Overall it’s spicy before dry down with a bit of lavender, and sweet like berries (MAYBE cranberry) with a powdery feel after which will last.Go test it for yourself at Sephora or something, don’t trust these reviews hating just to hate (aka Djani_V)"

Way overpriced althought i said i like it i don't think i will ever get a full bottle once my 10ml decant runs out. Maybe another decant if i feel like irresponsible with my money again. Fun fact, i mostly got negative feedback from my friends, family and coworkers. Performance is average, standard 5-6 hours-ish with medium sillage and projection. When the best part of the fragrance is the bottle (which indeed looks good like all other fragrance from the Y line), you know you fucked up. Try it, if you like frankincense and get a bottle off Notino for almost half the price because it's regulalry discounted on there."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I'll keep my opinions fair about this one.Y L'Elixir is a great release from YSL. It smells extremely pleasant, probably one the nicest scents I've ever smelled of all fragrances in the Y line. It is also the most versatile because it is not as sharp as Y EDP and not as sweet as Y Le Parfum.It is a more woody and minty take to the Y DNA. It smells quite close to Y EDP, but Y L'Elixir is smoother and has more character. The opening is dryer too. They said it has oud, but it is barely noticeable. It is more about the freshness, slight spice, aromatic woodiness, and the cooling sensation from geranium. It still has that fruity character from the Y line. Even though it is unlisted, I can also smell a slight earthiness like vetiver here.It does smell more mature and elegant.I don't have this one in my collection (yet), but in my short time of experiencing it by full spraying it in the store, it has a really nice performance. Very long-lasting (9 or 10+ hours) with a great projection in the first hour or two.There's just one real problem about this fragrance, really. It is very expensive for a 60 mL bottle that they offer. It's getting hard to buy or recommend these ""Elixir"" designer fragrances because of how they choose to market this ""new concentration"".It's more exciting to buy fragrances from those niche houses these days, especially with how they can be found at an even cheaper price than these new designer fragrances. They are usually more unique and have better performance.Keep in mind that I am not one of those niche snobs who only recommends fragrances from niche houses or underestimates designer fragrances. I usually don't like to use any of those terms. But it is getting hard to justify what these brands are doing for the sake of marketing.With that being said, I do think that this fragrance gets too much hate. It is still a very good fragrance overall. Maybe after a year or two, more people would appreciate it.I'll wait for it to reach my local discounters before buying it."

Juniper berries are still present in this too, same with the bergamot, sage and lavender too.The scent profile has slightly changed from the intense with more of a dry vetiver scent coming out from the oud this fragrance finally is something that smells different from all the other Y fragrances... EDT, EDP, Eau fraiche, Live, Le Parfum all smelled pretty much the same but they made a significant different with the intense and elixir and changed up that dna quite a lot. I believe I compared the intense to gucci guilty pour homme intense and the gucci guilty flankers, seems like they're going down that route now but it's lost it's YSL charm just smells more like a gucci fragrance now combined with typical vetiver fragrances"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Y Elixir is a woody and aromatic fragrance.The opening is woody and dry, slightly dirty (I suppose it is the declared oud note), but more woody than anything else, although a fruity accord between bergamot and green apple is also perceived in the background that has already been shown in other fragrances by the Y line. As the minutes pass, the woods decrease in intensity, but they continue to give body to the aroma.The Elixir version of Y is a fragrance with more versatility than I imagined, in fact I think it could be used in any season of the year, both day and night, since the citrus-fruity accord remains throughout the year. fragrance development.In terms of longevity it performs very well, it lasted more than 12 hours on me, although in terms of sillage and projection, the first 2 hours are very good, but it gradually decreases, that is, compared to the Elixir of Sauvage, it does not reach that level of projection.Y Elixir is not a bad fragrance, however it has its disadvantages. Firstly, the price is very high for a 60ml bottle, secondly the aroma, at first the intensity of wood makes it different, but when pass the time it is very similar to Y EDP Intense, so the price once again becomes an inconvenience or disadvantage. Still, as always, my suggestion is that you try the fragrance for yourself and have your own conclusion."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I really dislike this. It smells like if Roja Dove was drunk in his kitchen during a dinner party and he took some herbs from his pantry and shoved them in a blender with some wild Haitian vetiver, one of his favorite notes, that he happened to have in the back pocket of his violet purple pants.Imagine if this fragrance wasn't ""YSL Y Elixir"" but rather a $30.00-60.00 perfume. You blind bought it from fragrancenet or fragrancebuy.ca because the notes looked good on fragrantica, or a youtube content creator you trust (I like Justin Copeland and Ashton Kirkland from Gents Scents) said it was good. You open the package (fragrancebuy.ca has the best mailing boxes in the business!) and you smelled this. Honestly, I would still be disappointed. I think some people (at least me) give YSL Y Elixir extra points just for being YSL's Fancy Elixir. If this mediocre juice came out of a cheapie bottle, I would honestly give it away or throw it away.I have been experimenting with layering this because I can't really deal with it on its own. I found an odd set of bed fellows that I kind of like together: 1 spray of YSL Y Elixir on the base for every 2 sprays of Dior Sauvage Eau Forte. In the opening, the 2 together smell like mint ice cream. In the mid, the Eau Forte mutes the annoying sharp synthetic vetiver-like accord I get with YSL Y Elixir. And in the late stages of the dry down, the extremely subtle yet incredibly intoxicating sweetness I get in Eau Forte's dry down continues to present itself. Despite this improvement, I still prefer Sauvage Eau Forte on its own rather than layered with YSL Elixir. I am just doing what I can to put lipstick on a pig."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Tried it at the store on a tester strip. The opening and mid do have frankincense and something that resembles oud that is mild, not only in concentration but also the type of scent (very safe). These two notes start to fade until the far dry down, where you are left with the typical shower gel Y DNA, which dominated from the opening and is closest to Y Intense.I understand where the hate comes from. Despite the elixir being a decent scent objectively, it is not worthy of the elixir name and definitely not worth the price. It would have been a decent flanker under a different title. However, to be fair it would have been difficult to come up with a solid Y elixir flanker since the line is blue, fresh, and safe. I think it was easier for sauvage and Le Male since sauvage can amp up it's spiciness and Le Male its sweetness.It seems they tried to darken the Y DNA here, but not too dark, keeping it fresh and blue. I'm just a collecter, but IMO YSL could've amped up the sweetness, building up on the sweetness of the EDP, and from there they could've either went the dark or fresh route, and either made it really fresh/aromatic and sweet, or dark and sweet. If they wanted to go with the dark theme, they shouldve amped up the oud and resins and added a few other notes, maybe tobacco, spices, iris, rose, or something that would make it more daring. Although, that would be a departure from the line's DNA.Like many have said, it a decent fragrance, but not worth the price. For it's retail price you can get a niche bottle at discounters and still have money left. At discounters it is priced similar (20$ cheaper) to some 50 ml Xerjoffs, I would go for the latter any day.

If it was a normal designer price I would own it. It is also a very similar vibe to Jo Malone's Oud & Bergamot, which I haven't seen mentioned. Still debating buying but no doubt I will eventually have a bottle if I find it at a good price. If you don't own any Y this is the one to get."

I love this! My new office scent. If I had to describe it, I would say this is a crazy love child of Y (or some other well made blue fragrance) and Haltane. More the former than the latter.Love the oud notes that come in the first hour or so and wish they would stick around a little longer. The blues show up and kind of elbow the oud out of the way a little bit but they never leave the party. They just hang out on the outskirts and let you know they are still there every now and then.Grab a decant and give it a try. It's something special."

I said it's crazy overpriced and completely redundant.Now it's starting to show up at discounters, and it's a completely different story.This is basically a better quality Y EDP. It's more natural, it doesn't have as much of that sweet, synthetic amber base, it has a really nice fresh elemi note, it doesn't project as much but it's longer lasting and harder to go nose blind to, This is better, hands down, but it probably takes more than one wear to tell the difference.If you own any of the other ones, especially EDP, avoid this. If you expect a middle eastern take on the original DNA, you're going to be disappointed.However, if you don't own anything from this line and you can find this for less than retail, then this might be the one to get."

I paired this fragrance with Oud Oil because I really wanted more Oud in this. Bottom Line, I will not purchase this simply because of the Price and longevity.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It's decent, although it's kind of sad that YSL had to release so many clunkers that smelled exactly the same before this one. Parfum Intense is decidedly better. At any rate, it's not special. It's a syrupy-sweet slush of orange and maraschino cherry. To me, there are no other detectable facets. No green apple and no frankincense. I'm seriously puzzled by anyone commenting on the presence of frankincense, let alone there being an overwhelming amount of it. Get your olfactory nerve checked, and stop relying on the advertisement briefs. There might be some oud-esque aroma chemicals in here, because there is a slight dankness, but again it's buried by the fruitiness. The sweetness prevents it from being a masculine fragrance. I would say it's unisex to feminine-leaning. If this were in the women's section, I wouldn't bat an eye. I also take exception to this being called an elixir, because it's not strong. Five years ago, this would've been a $50 fragrance. This is for one demographic: 15 year old Tiktokers."

They give fragrances a higher end feel . Not a fan of oud. But the oud in this is very subtle . Yes you can smell it but it's in its most light form. Just enough to carry the other notes in this. It's a simple fragrance but it does smell good. I can see why people like it. If you like Montblanc Legend you may like this too. It's is pretty linear. It's not going to have notes bouncing around , it's not going to make you think for a second about what you are smelling. You get the top and mid notes right away then the frankincense and light oud come in. Overall a simple bit very nice fragrance . I would use this as an evening scent but it's pretty versatile, it can be worn all year. Performance isn't bad but it's not strong like most elixirs out there. It projects pretty good for about 3 hours. Stays on the skin for a good 7 hours . Biggest issue is the price. This stuff is way overpriced. For $180 US I can get way better fragrances .."

It's definitely a departure from the rest of the Y line which many people adore (including me). The lavender off the top smells very synthetic and chemical-y.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The new elixir flanker for the Y line. I reached out to YSL directly and they sent me a sample to try out. With this being an elixir, I would expect it to be darker, deeper, and stronger; but so far the reviews have been very rough for this one. I'm excited to give it a wear and see how it is myself. Let's get into it;Scent:Opening is aromatic, citrusy, and floral. The primary notes I get are lavender, citrus, frankincense, and geranium. The strongest of the notes are the lavender and citrus. This is very unusual considering there is no citrus in the official note breakdown; but it's unmistakeable, there's a strong orange/mandarin note in there. It's juicy and rindy, like what you would find in John Varvatos' Artisan Pure. Upon further review of the notes, it seems frankincense can carry a fruity/citrusy accord, so I'm assuming that's what I'm picking up on. The lavender note is your standard designer lavender; soft, floral, and aromatic. This is followed by the frankincense and geranium. The frankincense is more woody than spicy or resinous, and the geranium hangs out in the background with a slightly rosy nuance, adding to the floral aspects of the lavender. The dry down is aromatic, citrusy, and woody. The primary notes I get are lavender, citrus, frankincense, and oud. The strongest of the notes are still the lavender and citrus with the same accords from the opening, just more mellowed out. This is followed by the same frankincense accord from the opening but the geranium has been swapped out for the oud note. The oud in this fragrance is not very typical of oud; there's no funkiness or animalic nature to it that's usually associated with oud, it just comes across as a dense woodiness similar to a cedar note.Performance:Initial projection is nuclear and easily filled the room when I walked in. The sillage matches that intensity with an unmistakeable scent trail. After about 3 hours the projection was still just outside arms length and the scent trail was still easily noticeable. At around the 7 hour mark the projection was still about arms length and the scent trail was still noticeable. The fragrance didn't become a skin scent until around the 10-11 hour mark.When to wear:This is very much in the style of a blue fragrance, and as such carries the same versatility. This would work well in any weather, any time of day, and any occasion. Wear it to the office, wear it on a date, wear it casually; it will always be an appropriate pick.Blind buy:If you like the Y line, or like blue fragrances in general, this is a safe blind buy for you.Final verdict:I don't really understand why this is getting as much hate as it is. It's not a huge departure from the rest of the Y line, and it's not particularly interesting or different; but it does what it sets out to do which is be a strong blue fragrance. This is personally my favorite out of the Y line, with my previous favorite being the hype beast Y EDP. I think this the more masculine and powerful flanker of the Y line, and that resonates with me. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solid blue fragrance they can wear for any occasion. Give it a try and don't let the nay-sayers dissuade you.Scent: 9/10Longevity: 8/10Sillage: 8/10"

That's just adding to the disrespect of this whole seemingly half-baked concept and release. Even Missoni Wave has a magnetic cap (as an affordable fragrance!), because they endeavored to respect the juice they're selling. If you can 3x the price, maybe you can then also demonstrate your equivalent respect and value in your product, as well. This would help your audience to actually believe in it... by seeing that YSL themselves do. Somehow there were no margins for that? The scent itself is a safe pleasant light kool-aid like skin scent with no lasting power or projection. If you spray it on one hand, and any other designer in the whole store on the other hand, the other hand will win/last longer (try it for yourself). I like the fragrance but the bottle, price, and longevity are lacking. I don't mind that it's a very weak fragrance except for the elixir categorization which is the part that feels like a failure."

I get a ton of soapy citrus in the opening which lasts for a couple of hours. It’s fleeting after that. No oud whatsoever. Oddly addicting scent though. I can’t stop smelling it. Stays close to skin after the first few hours. I really love it and I was surprised how fresh it is. It’s not dark or rich at all. I bought this and the edp at the same time and I think I prefer this. Lots of hate for this among the community but it grows on you the more you wear it. Picking up edp intense next as I love the creamy wood note in that one.Yea it’s a bit overpriced but you can tell the ingredients are quality. Smells different than the rest of the line.

I bought it at a discounter for about 100$ and I don't regret it one bit. Smells similar to the Y Intense but for me its less sweet, the ingrediets are more pronounced and it really does smell like an luxurious fragrance. Got a lot compliments from it, first by my wife and family at a gathering, then sporadically by coworkers and clients at work. It gets a lot of hate for the stupid elixir label and high price, but I judge it by the content of the bottle and its great. Lavender and geranium rule this, with a slightly sweet soapiness and woodiness. Can't feel the oud whatsoever. It lasts very long on my skin and has a nice sillage for about 2-3 hours, although I feel it on me all day long. Overall a great compliment magnet, confidence boosting scent for all year round. If you can get it for a good price, don't think twice"

This has an intensely fresh opening and a gorgeous drydown that I can’t get enough of, maybe my skin chemistry just agrees with this but it smells like I lathered myself in the shower with the most elegant and luxurious soap. I really can’t detect the oud here but there is a light and delicate woodsy base to it. The ingredients used here are very high quality and for me it is tied with Y Le Parfum as best in the line. Y EDP, Y Live and the updated EDT are still great, but this is definitely a deeper and more refined take on the Y dna and not redundant to me. Nothing juvenile here either, just clean, classy and gentlemanly. Haters gonna hate, which is a shame because it’s an extremely well crafted scent that you can wear literally any time and anywhere during just about any time of the year. Not sure how this would cut through the cold as it is on the clean and fresh side, but most would probably opt for something warmer and sweet then anyway."

It doesn't stink by any means, but there's a little sweet funk in the base that turned me off. It could be the frankincense I'm not sure. The opening and heart of this fragrance to my nose is amazing however. The projection and longevity aren't bad either. I won't be buying it though.

Smells incredible and very fresh. Reminds me of Y in the opening briefly but transitions away into its own thing. Very smooth, well blended. Performance isn't great at all. Way to expensive for what you get. Unfortunately a pass because of price"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"The accord in this comes across to me as having a hint of grape (like a faint fruit punch smell), which I enjoy. A slightly sweet and pleasant cologne. The performance however, is miniscule. Even on clothes, hours later it's hard to detect (which is remarkable). I don't mind short-lived colognes that are nice, because I don't mind reapplying, but for an ""Elixir"" moniker, the performance is pretty egregious and bound to upset people who expect elixir concentration (or reasonable value). This isn't even in the ballpark. At a doubled $180 price point, for a half-sized 60ml format, the performance to price ratio really should have made this dead on release internally (within this particular bottle); it's not remotely an elixir potency but was priced like one. There was an obvious disconnect between the concept and the results, yet a management team released it anyways. This liquid is EDT (maybe EDC) projection and longevity, and scent profile, at 3x the price, which is beyond odd. The performance warranted this in a 120ml bottle, and I would have said it's a light, fun, easy, worthwhile and office-safe cologne requiring reapplication.EDIT: Tested again today. It's a definite skin scent, and barely even that (try it for yourself). Even if the price drops, it will never make sense 1) as an Elixir, or 2) that it's in a tiny 60ml bottle. However I do enjoy the tame slightly sweet juice and faint musk + ISO E Super drydown. I often wear and enjoy inoffensive non-scents like M01, and when this hits a normal cost per ml (one that matches the scent), I'd probably be happy to wear it in the same situations where I want to wear a cologne but not have anyone know.Also, anyone that's upset that people are noting or complaining that the creative team took a skin scent, halved the size of the bottle, and tripled the price... really shouldn't be."

The smell feels like a lateral move from le parfum. It doesn’t deserve the elixir name. Clearly a cash grab. Trying to cash in on the new elixir trend. Where’s the oud lol. They put all these interesting notes in the list and it smells like the most basic woody smell with a hint of the Y dna.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As a fan of the Y line, I was fully prepared to go against the narrative surrounding this flanker and hopefully show it some love. Unfortunately, after testing it for a while now, I have to admit that all the criticisms are warranted.If you judge the fragrance on its own, I think it's just fine. The biggest difference I notice here is that there is almost a chlorine-like characteristic to this. Doesn't smell bad to me, but it's very apparent.Ultimately it's just the same Y DNA with very minor tweaks (higher quality ingredients + marine accord + a touch of oud which is undetectable).Context matters here. The best Elixir releases from other major brands have been somewhat ambitious, thus explaining the significant bump in price (some of them aren’t even this expensive). YSL Y Elixir just feels like more of the same, but with an Elixir price tag slapped onto it. For that very reason this falls into the underwhelming category for me."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This scent has one of the worst openings I have experienced in a fragrance in a while. It’s so off putting. This is a bad scent. I can’t believe this was even released. It has an odd soapy profile and smells like weed.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"When I first got my nose on this one I thought it was interesting but eventually concluded it was not collection worthy. My YSL Y EDT would have to remain the only fragrance I deemed worthy from the line. For clarification I mean the 2017 original version NOT the reformulated 2022 one. The reformulation did move slightly more in line with the EDP and the rest of the line and perhaps now you can understand why I do not like the 2022 or the rest of the line. Mind you it is still OK but the 2017 is to my nose by far the best of the line.Nevertheless, I would have to score a fragrance at least a 4 out of 5 to be collection worthy and as the elixir only just did not make the cut I was somewhat perplexed as to the exceedingly low score. At worst a 3.8, no way no how was this a 3.2. As luck would have it I decided to give it a proper wear one day when the sales person suggested I tried it on. I had rushed out and forgot to wear a fragrance so I thought why not. So I applied 5 sprays, 4 around the kneck and chest and 1 on my wrist for the occasional sniff. At first I thought, yup just about what I expected from smelling it off the strip. Pretty good but doesn't quite hit the mark. While I enjoyed the soapiness I found the incence and woods to be too sharp to my nose. Fast forward to about the 20 min mark, I start getting these wafts of lightly creamy, aldehydic soapiness. The incence and woods had oddly subsided a fair amount and was quite enjoying what was beginning to be a promising dry down. By the hour mark it had continued to become smoother creamier more soapy with the woods and the incence almost taking a second place to the lavender and the soapiness(don't ask me what ingredients create this) but just enough to produce a lightly woody/spicy clean fresh vibe.Imagine washing your body with expensive luxurious shower gel or soap, that is what this feels like. To that end I would say this can work all year round for ANY occasion, day or night, even the gym(in fact I think it would shine in such a setting provided you did not apply too much and gave it some time to settle). I later discovered that the trick to getting this soapy dry down was to apply in only on skin and avoid getting any of it on clothes. This gets you that dry down very quickly(within the first half hour). If however you enjoy the woods and incence but not so much the soapiness I would suggest apply only on clothes. This would prolong that woody incence opening for at least 2 hours and while you would still eventually get the soapiness somehow the woods and incence would stay with you at a higher concentration the full 8+ hours.Keep in mind that this lasts a long time but you may become anosmic to it after a while, however it is till there. It will project quite strongly for 2 -3 hours and then no more than a foot. Interestingly though, if you are in motion people around you will pick it up for sure, well into the 6+ hour mark. This thing is fantastic in the air and it leaves a great scent trail.At this point I would rate it no less than a 4.4/5, this is a hidden gem! People rating it a 3.2 are either off their rocker or have not properly tested it. Sadly on fragrantica way too many people rate fragrances they at most tested on their wrist once(usually just on strip). To get a proper feel for a fragrance you need to give it a proper wear and experience the whole cycle. I tested it twice for a full wear and each time it got better. Interestingly this seems to be a strong move back to the original EDT and away from all the other flankers(hence why I like it). At this point it is a toss up for me which one is better between l'elixir and the EDT(2017) though I think in time l'elixir will edge the EDT out due to the greater versatility while the price point is still not at the threshold where it would start to effect how I rate a fragrance. If you can get it for a decent 20 - 30% discount(what I can get around my parts) then this is a complete no brainer.Mind you, this would be good for you if you enjoyed maculine, soapy, clean, fresh, lightly woody/ spicy fragrances. If soapy fragrances aren't your thing then this may not be for you. I'm going through a soapy clean phase so this is right up my alley."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,So here's the thing I just tested this today. I had a two hour drive ahead of me after I left the mall and figured that was plenty time to keep myself engaged with Y L'Elixir. My mind is slightly made up only because of the cost and he fragrance it is. Yes it is soapy clean the frankincense smells great mixed in. I love oud but honestly couldn't find it. One thing the put me off to this is that it costs $220CAD and the first thing that came to my mind was a clean men's public washroom. I do not know what exactly in the notes is bringing this memory to me but it puts me off a tad after that thought. Maybe in the future I will revisit this or if it goes on for cheaper at discounters due to lack of sales then I might just pick it up and use it for work but right now it was a pass and I decided to go with Le Parfum.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Its a nice fragrance, probably the 2nd best YSL Y Flanker apart from the le parfum, my personal favorite. The only thing that sets me off from purchasing it is the heavy price tag for a 60 milliliter bottle. In my opinion, just get the le parfum as the 100 mililiter on discounters is less than $100, or just wait until this fragrance arrives at discounters."

But you’re right in a lot of regard, people just expect too much from every fragrance when some are obviously just going to be “utility” scents, or scents that do a job. Easy reaches and sweet & spicy date night fragrances - they’re all good at what they do and receive na lot of unjustified hate. The entire Y line has been good for me, all with SUBTLE differences that make them unique to the line. One who isn’t a fan at the line could likely stop at one and be just fine.What people really need to be aware of and understand (and I’ll die on this hill) is that “YSL” is just a brand, and as a brand they do little in terms of their fragrances. L’Oreal owns the market right now and are the reason so many releases smell the same. They take the same formula that works for one house, and rebrand/rebottle it as a “new release” for all the other houses they control."

A very clean designer style rubbery wood vibe. It's there.I'm a niche guy, but I have this whole line aside from the edp which is too sweet and cheesy for me, and they're all fine for what they are - fresh easy grabs for casual days and gym. Nothing special, but this one is borderline special.I think it's getting hate because it isn't a sweet creamy vanilla sugar bomb like the other elixirs. YSL took the elixir branding and went fresh, smooth and clean with it.If you're expecting something dense and dark and sweet a rich, you'll hate it. If you enjoy a noticeably higher quality and more natural smelling take on the DNA, you'll love it.It's expensive. We all get it. It's actually damn nice though. This is the one Y I won't be embarrassed to wear with a jacket or nice button up shirt in business casual situations.I'm not a fan of most designer frags, but this is very nicely composed.

It smells very clean, fresh, soapy and slightly sweet just like Y edp and Y le Parfum. It’s very aromatic and fresh spicy based. I applied 2 sprays on arm and it’s been about 4 hours since application and it’s still projecting very strongly.It’s very inline with every release of the line and sadly not much difference between this and Y edp, to where I can’t justify buying a full bottle, especially with the steep price and when the bottle size is only 60ml. This being said, it is the most high quality of the Y’s and I would say it’s my favourite of the bunch scent wise."

The projection however only goes strong for a good 2 hours until it starts slowly fading away.The closest comparison to this fragrance is ysl y le parfum with the dark scent but le parfum does not have that synthetic soap scent.Overall this is not a safe blind buy but I could definitely see an older office worker using this as their work scent.7/10

I do think this one smells the best and also the most mature. I think over time once this hits discounters people are gonna like it more.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I bought a fragrance yesterday at Macy's and before I left, I sprayed some of this on to give it a try. I love it and I went back later that day to buy it. I had low expectations because reviews have been crushing it across the board. I agree that it's not worth $180, but Macy's has it on sale for $150 which is still too expensive for what it is, but not as bad. I have most of the others from the Y line, all except Y Live. I actually think Elixir smells the best of them all, so I bit the bullet and paid the high price for the measly 60mL bottle.This and Gucci Guilty Elixir are modeling the same approach as Sauvage Elixir with the 60mL bottle at the same high price. I think Sauvage Elixir and Guilty Elixir are more justified because they have better performance with more niche-like scent profiles. Y Elixir is a blue shower gel freshie in the same vein as the rest of the line with nothing bold, challenging, daring or interesting going on. This fragrance should be bottled in the 100mL and priced no higher than Y Le Parfum. It's clear they are capitalizing on the Elixir name.I don't pick up any oud in this, it's not even very woody. What sold me on it is how the aromatic and spicy accords come across. The lavender in this smells really high quality and the geranium gives it some minty freshness. It smells well blended and very well put together. The woody and resinous base notes are not particularly heavy or prominent, this is a top and mid heavy fragrance. There's not a lot of development, it's actually fairly linear, more linear than the others in the line. I don't mind this because the top and mid notes are the best part of this fragrance and last the full wearing. The top and mid notes last forever because this is a synthetic fragrance, but the synthetics smell high quality.As for performance, the oil concentration does seem high and I do believe it's heavily concentrated. The longevity is great and the projection seems moderate, which is usually the case for heavy oil concentrations. Sauvage Elixir and Guilty Elixir are exceptions, as they are heavily concentrated with both amazing longevity and projection.Overall, compared to Sauvage Elixir and Guilty Elixir, which Y Elixir is directly competing against, Y Elixir seems less ""worth it"". Y Elixir has less character than those 2 and is less niche-like. Y Elixir doesn't have the performance of those 2. While Guilty Elixir and Sauvage Elixir clearly smell and perform like the premium products within their respective lines, Y Elixir smells more like a regular release within the line, just done really well, but shouldn't be priced as it is. Y Elixir was worth it for me because I love the Y line, think this is the best in the line, and got it on sale."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I am never a fan of Y line. Its DNA just really doesn’t match my personal taste. Having said that, I have always found it extremely difficult to distinguish any of its flankers from the very first EDT. They all smell almost 90%-99% identical to my nose! Normally I can distinguish the nuances of different flankers from a line, regardless of how minor it is. Y Line, i just always can't find them different at all…… seriously they smell too too too similar to me, all of them. (except Eau Fraiche)So now with this many flankers…. I could not help but wonder, whats the point?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As YSL’s Y line enters the fray with an Elixir, I can’t help but feel a sense of Elixir Exhaustion upon its arrival. Gone is the novelty, daring and strength Dior brought to the table with Sauvage’s Elixir, and the word is now becoming more synonymous with overly sweet and expensive flankers of diminishing value. YSL has crafted an Elixir peddling behind Y EDP with no desire to veer upon its own course.Of course. there are new dimensions to the new Y. I get the suggestion of oud in here and it adds a dark, woody edge to an otherwise shower-fresh scent. While it lends gravitas to the overall fragrance, it can also feel a bit of an odd choice given the character of the line. This is an oud that is so sanitized and smoothed over, it’s a bit like watching Scarface on regular television with all the violence and profanity removed. You get the idea of what it is, but are also acutely aware what you’re experiencing is a sterilized version of what you’ve experienced before.Apart from that, this Elixir feels the same as the tried and true Y EDP. The oud-i-ness melts away in the dry down and what remains is the ambroxan-y sweetness immediately recognizable to anyone familiar with the Eau de Parfum. Long story short, get Y EDP and save a bit of money. It is largely all you’re getting here."

It's like they took the EDT or EDP and added some 'oud' but really it's just inky vetiver like Encre noir. I'd expect a bit more of a polished product from YSL but seems like they are just capitalizing on the Elixir craze and threw this together. Elixir flankers should at least be bold and long lasting but again they missed the mark here.Take the EDT/EDP apply a few sprays then layer with a spray of Encre Noir and you have this Elixir version.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Fragrance Review:First thoughts, Y Elixir is very similar to Y EDT. The original Y.- The first few seconds after spraying this, you get quite a synthethic Lavendar aromatic sweetness mixed with the airy Geranium scent before the base oud note appears.- After about an hour to two hours, the projection starts to simmer into a skin scent and making this fragrance smelling more like the YSL Y Intense.- I sprayed a total of 5 times. Twice behind each ear, twice on the front of neck, and once in front of my chest. The projection and longevity is Amazing, it lasts approximately 10-12 hours on my skin, and projects about an hour to 2 hours before it turns to a skin scent. (Depends on skin types)Overall Rating (8/10)- It's very pricy for a scent that smells similar to Y EDT, costing over €120+ for a 60ml is insane. But given it's an elixir, I guess they can charge such high prices. I would recommend you to try this first before buying as it may be redundant if you already own the other Y flankers."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Reading the reviews leaves an impression that people expected this to be very much darker than it is. May be people hoped it to be a flanker of EDP or Le Parfum rather than an elixir version of EDT (which it is and what a beautiful version of that it is if you ask me). So it is definitely a more concentrated version of EDT rather than trying to deepen the darker versions of Y line. This is fresh and citrusy. Smells totally different on air/clothes than from my skin. The longevity and performane on clothes is counted in days. 1 spray on my winter coat sleeve lasted 3 days. The freshness here is not headache inducing like in EDP, which is a good thing for me. This is rich and full and the citrus is very natural here. A bit like Dior Homme Sport 2021, but without the Issey Miyake Vetiver part making it have less cola vibes. Not worth the price in my opinion. I bought a 10 ml version for 45 € and for that price it is ok considering I probably never run out of it due to using usually around 150 different fragrances throughout a year."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"SMH here we go again! Yet another cash grab “Elixir” that smells exactly like the EDP, just slightly woodier and not as strong. When will everyone realize “elixir” no longer means perfume concentration, but is now a marketing slogan. Shame on all the new releases that are doing this nonsense. What an absolute disgrace to a line that made Y Le Parfum, the most beautiful male fragrance YSL has created next to LNDL & Tuxedo. The worst part is the price. A 60ml will drain you $180 and around $200 after taxes. Might as well just get a 100ml niche on discounters for less or the same price."

Then it starts to grow more woody and resinous, like, a lot. On my skin, what I feel the most is the incense/resinous vibe of this scent, reminds me a lot of what JPG Elixir does with this note. It projects, not as much as other Elixirs, but more than the Y EDP for example.I think it is one of those that smells better in the air than in your skin. Not my favourite of the line, but it's good for special ocassions and so on."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Nowadays, when we hear the word Elixir, we immediately think deeper, darker, heavier, and possibly longer lasting. In that respect, this Y is a complete misnomer. To me, the EDP Intense smelled fresher than the EDP. The Elixir smells even more fresh than the Intense, with everything else being VERY similar to its siblings. To be clear, it is not bad at all. It is fresh, the least synthetic smelling in the line with good longevity (got about 6-7h with one spray on my skin), but not worth the price IMO especially if you have any other Y's. I'd say this is for someone who has never tried the Y line but wants to get one bottle out of the entire line and is willing to fork $180 for 60mL. He'll still be happy with the smell I'm sure, since the entire Y line is pretty good overall."

Actually it takes the journey from the edp intense further in to a smoother and woodier base. Yes there is no OUD, but a artificial oud like in oud wood, made by chemicals who resemble also cedar wood.Its a good scent and it makes sense. Do nor take the name to seriously as its not stronger then the edp for example. Its more intense perhaps a few more percent more perfume instead of alcohol.. I mean it smells smoother and more grown up.So lwts say the niche version of the EDP and EDP intense without that heavy sickmaking apple kind of amell of the EDP. Altough its very versatile i wont recommend it on humid weathers, since tjwt woody base can become to much. 7/10 but for what it is.. its where it should be as a frag. The price altough i cannot justify. I bought it at the airport for a 100€ but still was not convinced to pay that amount aft3r usage.For the performance seekers or simple souls: its just YSL Y with gasoline the first hour second hour similar to edp drydowb..and then whoops its gone haha very weak performer for sure."

When Dominique was asked to create this for the house, he had to keep the fragrance within the line. Of course this is going to have that fresh, soapy clean ""designer"" type atmosphere to it. Its the Y by YSL line, he wasn't going to go and create something completely off the beaten path. Let me remind you this man is the perfumer behind Portrait of a Lady, he is more than capable of creating outstanding work.What you get here is incredibly high quality raw materials, the radiant woodiness is coming from raw materials that have been specifically made to do just that. Probably from a very well known chemical compound company like Givaudan which is why this fragrance is expensive.You're not buying the heights of perfumery. You're in the Y range don't kid yourself, you know what you're getting. This is well worth the money you only need one spray and it'll last all day."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Total garbage. I was really excited to see that YSL made an elixir version of Y. Y eau de parfum is one of my favorite fragrances, and its performance is nuclear. So I'm thinking, how can they top that? Usually elixirs are more concentrated right? Nope, apparently not according to YSL.I went straight to Macy's after work when I saw it, I didn't even look up reviews or anything beforehand so I would have an unbiased opinion. First thing I noticed when smelling the cap of the tester is that it's kind of... flat. And almost... unisex smelling? I don't mind unisex, but I was expecting something a bit more masculine having the Y in mind. I know it's a flanker, but I wish it would've been stronger. It didn't smell bad, it's YSL, it smelled good of course. But nothing like the complexity and wow factor of Y eau de parfum and La Nuit de L'Homme. It's like they just took the leftover Y batches of every other type and mixed it together; and honestly wouldn't be surprised if they actually did that seeing as the only reason they even made this was to profit off the elixir trend.A couple hours later I went to smell my wrists that I sprayed with the tester... almost nothing. I asked my girlfriend what she thought because I had just got home and she wasn't around it all day to be noseblind to it. I asked her what she thought of this cologne, her response after sniffing it? ""What cologne? You just smell like yourself after work.""It appears as though some people on this site actually enjoy it enough to hit the ""loved it,"" rating. I feel like those people need to better educate themselves on what makes a good fragrance. It has to smell great, last long, and project enough to leave a scent trail and have people arms length away be able to smell it. Y Elixir by YSL only has one of those three things. Shame. But, hey, if you like it, more power to you. Just know that you're part of the problem. Just saying.So yeah, this is what happens when companies blindly jump on the bandwagon for profits. Thanks, YSL. For getting my hopes up and immediately crushing them. You hit paydirt with Savauge elixir, but maybe you should've quit while you were ahead. Savauge elixir is what started the elixir trend we see these days. It is a fantastic fragrance, lasts forever, projects great, and smells great. This? Not at all. Not even in the same league. Savauge elixir's longevity and projection alone are in its own class compared to this. Orders of magnitude above it. I may be a little dramatic about this but I'm honestly kind of sad and upset by it. Maybe I'm just getting too passionate for this hobby.You see, the difference is that YSL actually put time and effort into a quality product with Savauge elixir and it shows. People love it. It's an awesome fragrance. I'm tired of this economy where companies think they can--and actually do--get away with selling a sub-mediocre product they made on a Sunday afternoon; and for way too much money, just because they know people will buy it regardless. But that's not good enough. Not for me, and it shouldn't be for everyone else too. That goes for every product that's fallen victim to shrinkflation and the prioritization of profit trends over actual quality goods.Hey YSL, if you're reading this, here's some advice from a lifelong fragrance enthusiast: put more time and effort into your next men's fragrance if you want it to actually be a success and not this commercial failure-cash grab-bandwagon hopping-laughing stock of a cologne. I promise, you'll get more profits than doing what you just did. I end this review with some bitter contempt, a little resentment, and complete and utter disappointment. Seriously, how can you make an elixir that is WEAKER than the eau de parfum of the same line? What a joke. Don't buy this garbage.TL;DR: As you can see on this site, Y Elixir by YSL is an epic fail of a fragrance. A product made specifically for profits, and a disgrace to the Y fragrance line. Zero longevity, an uninspired scent profile, and a price that makes you wish you took that opportunity to make more money when you were younger. I think it goes without saying, don't buy. Just get the eau de parfum if you haven't already."

This smells like Y EDP with less sweetness from the apple and a touch of Oud/balsamic qualities. I don’t understand where the hate is coming from other than the price. It’s Y EDP with oud and that’s a win in my book, stuff smells great. Give it some time and people are going to love this one and appreciate it for what it is. It’s nothing ground breaking, but flankers are NOT supposed to be 90% different than the fragrance that came before. So I don’t know why everyone’s mad that it’s not a completely different fragrance than Y, it’s a flanker for goodness sake. As for performance, don’t listen to dumb YouTubers who judge off of first sniff. This lasts 8+ hours easily and I’ve gotten around 10 every time I’ve worn it. Do yourself a favor and form your own opinion and don’t listen to these idiotic YouTubers. And to be clear no, I don’t think it’s worth retail but that’s just the nature of the beast at this point.Why do I appreciate this fragrance? Because it’s still versatile and mass appealing but has a unique touch from the Oud and can be worn 12 months of the year."

They blended parts from others in the Y line and made it beast mode. The end. This stuff lasts 12+ hours on everything it touches with just one spray. High price tag mystery solved. Scent profile remains rather familiar leaving me feeling less than inspired, but it does smell nice. Probably best suited for the office as a fresh and inoffensive scent that actually lasts all day"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I really want to like this, I really do. It’s a perfectly fine designer fragrance on par with other popular designer fragrances as far as mass appeal goes. The problem I have with this and other designer fragrances is the quality of the materials used and the recycled themes and scent profiles. Like most, I started my fragrance journey wearing designer and clones, but once I graduated to niche perfumery, I find it’s becoming exceedingly difficult to fully appreciate them like I once did. The quality just isn’t there. The designer fragrances of yesteryear were original and made with higher quality materials and better blends, nowadays, everything designer smells redundant, cheap and synthetic. They’re all becoming uninspired money grabs more and more with every release. Even though I HATE the scent profile of Savauge Elixir, I can’t deny the high quality of that fragrance and it’s the LAST designer released that is deserving of fanfare. I can’t tell if my nose has evolved and I’ve become spoiled and influenced by my large niche collection or if it’s that designer fragrances have just fallen off with the quality and originality. I’m inclined to think it’s the latter. Am I alone in this?! Something just isn’t connecting anymore with the status quo of designer fragrances. Even though I LOVE niche perfumery, I’m not a pretentious fragrance snob that looks down on designer but Damnit, they’re just no good anymore! Am I alone in this?! Make designer great again!"

YSL are just all about the money now rather than trying to create something awesome and unique. If you have Y EDP, you're already set and all of these redundant flankers don't even come close to being better, nevermind taking the line in a new direction... Avoid, avoid, avoid! Performance in this Elixir is even worse than Y EDP!If you want a classier version of Y EDP, just get Y Le Parfum.There's absolutely no Oud in this either, folks. I didn't know Wood scents equated to Oud now.2/10 release at best. One of the biggest disappointments of 2024 100%.A shame and disgrace to the Elixir releases that Sauvage Elixir kicked off.If you have $180 and can only buy one fragrance, buy Dior Sauvage Elixir 100 times out of 100.If you have $360 and can only buy two fragrances, buy one bottle of Dior Sauvage Elixir and one bottle of Boss Bottled Elixir!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Let me preface this review by saying YSL Y EDP is one of my favorite and most complimented fragrances of all time. I own five 100ml bottles and 4 of them are bone dry. I wore it like a maniac and just couldn’t (and still can’t) get enough. Moving on to Y Elixir - I smelled this on skin/paper today at Macy’s. As much as it pains me to say this, it’s the most underwhelming version of an Elixir I’ve had the displeasure of putting my nose on. It opened smelling like frozen lemonade mixed with piss and never evolved into anything worth while. With their most recently releases (MYSLF and Elixir) they have gone from a 10 to a 2 in my book. YSL should stop trying to set trends and go back to their roots. Every single Elixir fragrance that comes to mind is deeper, darker, richer, spicier, better performing and 99% of them are cheaper. This one is none of that and I expected so much more. To say I’m let down would be an understatement. Simply not worthy of an Elixir status - and certainly not worth the money."

It's a strong like for me. He's the older cousin to the young Y family. He's smooth, secure in himself and always well dressed (Scent). The only down side is, he tends to think he's all that and a bag of chips so let him tell it, he's a premium, high value guy (Price).

I absolutely love the Y line and was excited for a new release, that was until I've heard about the new YSL Y that was about to release: Y Elixir. Really? I thought the elixir cashgrab trend was over already. But I still held my hopes up until I saw the notes and that absurd price. $180 for 60ml??? it's even more pricy than the average niche fragrance. I can already sense some tiktok kids say ""mUH ouD iS rArE ThAt'S WHY iT's SO eXPENSiVE"" and I'd totally agree if the oud wasn't this synthetic piece of garbage.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I tried three elixirs in the store today. Boss Scent, YSL Y and Gucci. Regarding YSL Y, I must first say that I have Y Live, Y EDP and Le Parfum in my collection. Elixir is not bad, but for the price it is a bit redundant for me considering that I have the mentioned three versions. Just the same DNA and very small differences, nothing special or different like for example Dior Sauvage Elixir in the Sauvage line. As for The Scent, I've never been a big fan, so even Elixir didn't really impress me, but Gucci Elixir is my cup of tea. I absolutely love it, a very unique men's spicy floral fragrance. Masterpiece."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Why is this Y, not the original Y? Why?Yves Saint Laurent launched ""Y L'Elixir"" two weeks ago. Today, I received a decanter of it.It turns out to be a deep woody and spicy deviation on Y. The fragrance is more complex than what you may think just by looking at the notes. You get white lavender at the top. White lavender has a scent similar to the traditional purple lavender but adds a rosemary camphorous twist. This opening is herbal and earthy suggesting that a sage note may be present as well. There is also a citrusy trace (grapefruit? bergamot? ginger? all of them?) to round up the opening with some freshness.The heart does not show a big difference from the previous stage as its earthy and lavender accord still endures. The development shows some new spicy and rosy facets while the herbal and citrusy nuances still hang around. This behaviour may be easily explained by the influence of the geranium listed note (geraniol).You can feel the fragrance woodiness in the early stages but it becomes bolder in the base. The dominant woody accord is derived mainly from oud. Oud detractors may rest assured that this note is very clean, well-behaved and not medicinal. It is present but it's not pungent. Other woody notes seem to be there as well even if they are not listed (cedar? patchouli? vetiver? all of them?). The earthiness detected before did not disappear and increased. I would not be surprised if the vetiver note from the other Y releases was kept, and, if so, it is probably of the Javanese variety. Finally, I easily perceive a leathery facet as well. The leather note may be derived from the oud itself, smoked birch (not listed), or other sources.Frankincense plays a background role and serves the purpose of amplifying the woody accords. If the listed base notes suggest an Oriental fragrance, that's not the scent type you get. It's a woody fougère with white and fark facets (white lavender and oud/leather).All in all, I dare to write that this perfume is not a flanker. It has its individuality besides an increased performance. I kind of liked the previous Y editions (mainly the EDP version) but probably I will become more enthusiastic about this Elixir version. Strangely enough, my nose suggested the same type of ideas with Sauvage EDP and Sauvage Elixir. I prefer this version to the previous Y versions. I also do not consider this Elixir redundant to their Y brothers. As I inferred before, it seems a new perfume and not just another flanker.The bottle has the same design type and has been created by Suzanne Dalton for YSL.Music: Tom Waits & Crystal Gayle - ""One From The Heart"""

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Picked this up today from Macy's. It is definitely a different spin on the Y DNA. The opening is strong soapy but not harsh. The soapiness dies down and the oud base really starts to shine. People like myself that appreciate a good oud note will like this one but it is not like the oud note you'll find in Haltane.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is probably gonna be a controversial cologne, personally its not bad but I don't like how strong the soapiness is. It starts to get better and feel more like that classic YSL Y when it dries down but I'm gonna have to sit on this for a couple days/weeks to see if its better than le parfum or intense (which are my favorites). Personally I think they should've taken a dior approach and made something a lot darker/sweeter but still retaining some of the iconic dna."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Just got mine today & it’s very strong not that sweet. Smells like a stronger higher quality Y DNA that’s very soapy. It reminds me of the soapiness from the new Valentino rockstud noir but higher quality. Still testing it out but this might be my favorite Y flanker. Update the drydown is very nice as the soapiness tones down turning into a mix of the edp & le parfum. This should have been the intense & ysl should have an elixir that is much darker & sweeter.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is darker YSL Y EDP without the sharp brain-piercing apple note. The same DNA, just a tiny bit different again. Beast mode projection the first couple of hours. In my opinion the best flanker. But not different enough to justify the purchase if you already own Y EDP or Intense.Do not expect to smell any oud like you may know from Haltane and other oud fragrances."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Y-Elixir-90024.html,Y Elixir Yves Saint Laurent cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I think people are misunderstanding this fragrance.First and foremost for people who are complaining that this is overpriced for what it is, thats completely wrong. When Dominique was asked to create this for the house, he had to keep the fragrance within the line. Of course this is going to have that fresh, soapy clean ""designer"" type atmosphere to it. Its the Y by YSL line, he wasn't going to go and create something completely off the beaten path. Let me remind you this man is the perfumer behind Portrait of a Lady, he is more than capable of creating outstanding work.What you get here is incredibly high quality raw materials, the radiant woodiness is coming from raw materials that have been specifically made to do just that. Probably from a very well known chemical compound company like Givaudan which is why this fragrance is expensive.You're not buying the heights of perfumery. You're in the Y range don't kid yourself, you know what you're getting. This is well worth the money you only need one spray and it'll last all day."

Stays close to skin after the first few hours. I really love it and I was surprised how fresh it is. It’s not dark or rich at all. I bought this and the edp at the same time and I think I prefer this. Lots of hate for this among the community but it grows on you the more you wear it. Picking up edp intense next as I love the creamy wood note in that one.Yea it’s a bit overpriced but you can tell the ingredients are quality. Smells different than the rest of the line.

Polo 67 has top notes of pineapple, bergamot and lemon; middle notes of sage, juniper and rose hip; and base notes of vetiver, patchouli and goldenrod. RL released two similar note profiles in previous years Ralph's Club with the notes of lavender, clary sage, Virginia cedar and vetiver. RL followed it up with Ralph's Club Parfum which added notes of apple, grapefruit, geranium, orange blossom, patchouli and cashmeran.Polo 67 is a mix of the Ralph's Club with some more blue notes namely the citrus notes up top and an Aventus like pineapple. Now before I have people jump on me, it doesn't have the black currant bite Aventus and the like or other features of clones and inspirations have but the pineapple and bergamot mix does remind me of Aventus. It then goes into a more blue direction as the sage mid kicks in. The base is really muted for vetiver and patchouli standards. Thank goodness there is no goldenrod trace because it might make me sneeze. I used to not be able to be within 5 miles of goldenrod fields...Polo 67 is a nice spring, summer and warmer fall scent. You can wear it on dates because it is a unique enough profile. Pineapple with citrus before going into clary sage. It smells clean and mass appealing so you won't be too challenging. It isn't a projection bomb so I wouldn't wear it clubing or during winter. Get a Ralph's Club flanker for that. However this will work for dates, work and casual wear.Polo 67 I feel gets a bad rap. Some of it is deserved since RL did a very clary sage heavy fragrance and a Parfum to go with it. Now this is not as woody as the Ralph's Club fragrances. For this reason it is a 7.0 it isn't amazing but far from banal even in a day and age where everything is blue or bleu.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I feel that this fragrance has gotten a bad hand out of the gates. I have seen reviewers say it is “basic”, “common”, “another shower gel blue fragrance”. I don’t really get that this is a blue fragrance in any way, shape, or form. I have BdC, Sauvage, Dylan Blue, Luna Rosa Carbon, YSL Y Edp, and this is not in that family at all.My experience is:1. For a freshie, it lasts 6-8 hours on me.2. It projects ok, i can catch whiffs of it all day3. It has a great opening, the opening is addictive4. It may smell safe, but doesn’t smell like anything else out except MYSLFI think overall performance is solid, value isn’t bad, and it is slightly different to what is out there. The pineapple opening drys down to a more herbal, fougere vibe and not a typical Ambroxan bomb with mint and vanilla. Polo hasn’t been one of the big names for a while and I get that most of their stuff comes and goes quickly to discounters; however, I feel that they tried on this one and didn’t just make the 5000 Aventus/Sauvage clone (cough cough Eros Energy)."

Said I smell musty and almost like piss😖. I thought it was alright, not Amazing, and not bad either, . I'd been on the fence with this one, gotten few samples & tried it couple times, but put it on tonight after shower and my wife had never smelled it before, but she instantly knew she did Not Like it at All. So I guess this is a no go for me. I have Allot of frags and none have gotten this type of reaction outta my wife. For reference she really likes the YSL MYSLF le parfum version , Quite a bit actually🤷🏼♂️ she hasn’t smelled the original MYSLF . The End"

It does share that same Fougere backbone style, but this one isn't as deep warm musky as Myslf. This is the daytime version, so to speak.The pineapple is noticeable, but it's not a tangy, bright, sharp pineapple. It's more mellow and sweet like pineapple juice.Clary sage plays an important part in this fragrance. That's what gives it the dark herbal quality and leans it into the classic Myslf Fougere style.Surprisingly good longevity. I sprayed 4x at 8am in the morning and got whiffs of it way past 4pm.

Yes, easy reach, but I think there’s something in the middle that makes it stand out. It’s almost a savory quality in an otherwise fruity aromatic scent.. perhaps it’s the sage. Also, this is a powerful frag. I’m nervous to see reviews implying it’s weak or safe to overspray because when my husband wears even 2-3 sprays of this I can’t smell my own perfume anymore lol"

The fragrance opens fresh and green, giving you a straightforward and pleasant aroma.Lemon and pineapple are present but not as prominent as you might expect. The pineapple adds a slight sweetness, while the lemon gives a fresh touch, but neither overpowers the other notes.As it dries down, there’s a very subtle hint of rosehip that adds a soft floral nuance. This makes the scent feel a bit creamier and smoother as it settles.Overall, Polo 67 is a simple, creamy, floral woody citrus fragrance. It’s easy to wear, fresh, and doesn’t try to do too much, making it a good choice for everyday use"

At this stage it reminds me a little of Myslf by YSL, but after a few minutes the pineapple note begins to be perceived, which in In this case it has a sweet and tropical smell, like when the pineapple is opened when it is at its point of maturity, that smell is very rich. The smell of the dry down phase is sweet amber floral with some herbal and woody accords.Polo 67 is a versatile fragrance, it could be used all year round, in any season, both day and night, for situations that do not require much formality, in fact it is a casual fragrance, one of those that you can wear at any time. moment and it smells good.It has very good longevity, it stayed with me for 12 hours aprox. with a good projection for the first hour and then it goes down but maintains an aromatic sillage beyond an arm's length.In terms of artistic creativity, this fragrance does not contribute much, it seems like an amalgamation of several fragrances such as Myslf, Invictus, a Polo Red and it even has a bit of Boss Unlimited, but it is very well combined, it is easy to like, it is attractive and it is modern , and I personally really liked its aroma. I think this fragrance will sell very well."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"As with many department store fragrances, Polo 67 is criticized for being generic. And that's a pretty fair thing to call it. But that's what this type of fragrance is meant to be, isn't it? Just like Dior Sauvage, YSL Y or MYSLF, or most of the fragrances listed under the ""People who like this also like..."" section above, it's meant to appeal to the average consumer and not to the enthusiast. That's not to say it won't appeal to enthusiasts as well, however. It's just a good, easy to wear scent that is fresh and clean with just enough fruity sweetness to not make it headache inducing. The pineapple and citrus opening is great and lasts a good while on my skin before the mids come through and the aromatics take over. The sweetness remains through the life of the fragrance though as it dries down into a mildly sweet and somewhat greenish vetiver and patchouli base, not the dark and earthy type. Goldenrod, according to my findings, is apparently similar to anise. I'm not too sure I get a whole lot of that but perhaps that lends to the aromatic sweetness here? But I'm just guessing. Longevity is pretty good for me and easily lasts through a day of work with good projection as well for a couple of hours. It's tough to ask for more out of this type of scent in an EDT formulation. Sure, it's generic and not the most exciting release. But it smells good, performs well, and isn't terribly expensive either compared to many designer releases nowadays."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Main criticism I see about this is that it's generic, which doesn't really bother me. Honestly, as far as a fresh, easy to wear, people pleasing scent, I think RL hit the nail right in the head with this one. Surpassed my expectations.The pineapple in the opening is indeed very pleasant. The fruits/citruces here aren't tart or sharp, they are more on the ""juicy"" side, which lends a certain sweetness to the fragrance as it dries down.I can see the comparison to MYSLF, but I definetly prefer this one, possibly because I'm a bit over ambroxan at this point -- a note that is very noticeable in the YSL release -- but is absent here. People are criticizing the drydown, but I think it smells really good all the way through. I have a small collection that leans rather heavily towards fresher scents because of where I live and I find myself continuously reaching for this one.Performance is very decent. I haven't counted the hours, but I would say it has above average performance for its genre. Lasts a long time and has decent projection. Very solid release IMO."

Similar citrus openings, but this is heavier on the woody notes especially after it settles, you can really pick up the juniper in this. As for what you’re getting, its designer, the point is a mass appealing fragrance that can be worn all day. I really don’t understand the trope of comparing these fragrances to niche fragrances and, if you’re worried about this being a niche profile then it isn’t for you. Move along. Anyways, this will be a good buy at discounters, but at retail pricing It’s hard to justify over MYSLF."

I would even classify this as unisex. The thing is it's way too sweet for my tastes. This may be one of the sweetest scents I've ever tried. This seems to be where perfumery targeted towards males is going and I'm not a fan.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Another great addition from Ralph Lauren. It starts with a great, citrusy pineapple opening and sweetens up in the dry down, but not in an overbearing way. This has been my most complimented fragrance by far, and I've had it for only a month or so. Polo 67 is a very crowd-pleasing scent with compliments spanning from all age ranges. Some call it generic and I can understand that. It reminds me of YSL MYSLF in that there are no groundbreaking or out-of-the-box notes that could turn people away. That can be seen as ""generic"" or safe and that is entirely up to you. Personally, I think that it smells incredible and it is my new daily fragrance for the summer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Fantastic citrus opening that makes you want to buy it but drydown is quite generic with a mix of powder, citrus, and vetiver and a very slight glimpse of pineapple. Unless that's just my imagination like those hearing tests where you think you heard something. It's a freshy so lasted about 4 hours with about 6 sprays. I'll wait for the EDP."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Without a doubt one of the best openings in the designer world on the freshie side. I was not expecting it to be this good. Opening is fantastic. Love it. Very enjoyable. Stays clean from opening to drydown with a sweet fruity mid which does also contain the bubblegum. The drydown stays fruity but is simply generic and not that enjoyable. Very flat drydown. The goldenrod has a weird smell not terrible just not as appealing as the opening or mid. I think the price on this one will come down in a few months once the hype dies down and everyone realizes that this is just a basic generic fragrance that comes with a fantastic opening. Solid overall but currently still overpriced.

Don't forget this is a blue fragrance, so versatility will be one of its biggest advantages.Here in Mexico Blue 67 hasn't hit discounters and I would not pay $100+ for it, but definitely I'm looking forward to adding it to my collection"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This really reminds me of Polo Red but is sweeter, less spicy, more powdery, and more aromatic. It opens with sweet notes of fruit (no tartness from either the pineapple or citrus notes), morphs into that ""bubblegum"" note that is found in a lot of other popular fragrances such as Invictus, and then finally dries down into the vetiver. People seemed to have been excited about the pineapple in this, but the note just adds to the sweetness rather than standing out on its own.Not a bad fragrance by any means and is a solid daily wear that most people will probably find pleasant. Definitely has a nostalgic character about it that reminds me of a scent that would've came out in the 2000's.Performance is around 4-6 hours for me, which isn't poor but not great either.This release is a good introduction to Polo but I wouldn't bother if you already own a Polo Red. Ralph Lauren definitely played it safe and went with what works with this one."

The woodiness gets stronger after it dried fully down.I actually got many compliments with it in a short time which surprised me.People saying it smells ""boring"" or ""generic"", thats wild to me. It has its own touch and it does that pretty well.I get around 6-7h out of it with it becoming a skins cent after around 5-6h.For the price (paid 100€) and the amount you get (125ml), its a extremely good deal.Def one of my top10 summer scents this year! :)"

I've smelled this profile 100 times over and it's rather boring for someone who owns over 200 fragrances.If your starting out it would be a decent enough dumb reach everyday wear but I wouldn't buy this.Starts strong but then goes close to the skin after 20 or so minutes and there's zero projection after that.Glad I only sampled.

Sure, I can smell it, after it squirts from the bottle through the air, and onto my skin, but after that...?!I've started to do double shots on my wrists and neck/collar bone area, just to see if I get better performance, but why?! Unfortunately, I bought the biggest bottle they had. Needless to say, it'll outlast me. ☹️For an EDT, I'd expect more projection, but sad to say.. it acts more like a typical parfum... without the longevity.Imo, this is 100% NOT a blind buy!"

Unfortunately I cannot stand the pineapple note in any shape or form. 67 has got loads of ripe pineapple juice which is way too much for me.

It keeps some sweetness from the pineapple, though the bergamot is the big hitter. Soon the aromatics push into the picture. It dries down to a very clean vetiver style / aromatic scent.Spring / summer use, maybe early fall. I would say 65° and up, but in the heat would work best. Longevity is moderate between 4-5hrs on skin. Sillage / projection isn't very good.

Like i said in my review, its boring and generic for serious fragrance enthusiasts. But polo 67 is good for beginners and for those who are not really into fragrances. It smells nice.

This is a run of the mill bubblegum scent profile, which you’ll find in most of these mass appealing designer fragrances such as MYSLF, Born in Roma, Ralph’s club, legend spirit, etc. the only difference is this fragrance does have a tropical touch with the pineapple which is definitely discernible. Pretty average performance, isn’t bad but it’s not great either. Overall you can’t really go wrong with this stuff, but if you have another frag that I listed above or fits that archetype there’s really no need for this, but if you don’t this is a blind reach frag which is mass appealing and won’t offend anyone’s nose, also pretty good at pulling compliments."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Nothing innovating IMO. Still smell good. Last on me, a good 5 hours. Very fresh aromatic scent. Good for daily wear. Kinda boring a little bit. But still good."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Smells amazing and lasts a decent while. I went to the mall to smell some newer releases and this stood out as the best thing I smelled even past the Tom Fords and Frederic Malles that I went out of my way to try.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Was ready to write it off as a hyper-generic mass appealing fruity thing, and it is that, but after it sits for a second it develops an interesting little bitter ""zing"" that kind of sets it apart from some of the other stuff in this genre. Kinda reminds me of lemon rind specifically. It's sorta nice!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"sweet, fresh, masculine, citrusy, opens up very strong. very mass appealing and safe, nothing special"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is very much like myself, but way better. It’s fresher, more vibrant, complex and masculine.To my absolute amazement I could easily still smell this on my skin a full 13hr and a sleep after application.This is a supremely decent frag in this modern dumb reach style.Recommended!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"My first impression of Polo 67 is that is smells crazy similar to the Polo Red line, not sure to which of those it leans more towards yet. It seems like it has a bit more of a rindy mineral sort of citrus to it. I went nose blind pretty quick while trying to compare them and will add to this as I wear it. It’s pretty fantastic either way. Generic? I guess. I don’t know why blue freshies are “generic” while oud fragrances are somehow exempt from the same logic. I feel like so many ouds smell the same as each other even over large price levels and find them to be very generic. I love freshies, the more the better but maybe let actual people do the perfumery rather than ai. Humans are gonna ai themselves right into having no reason to get out of bed each day.After continuing to wear it I still find it very similar to Red but different enough that you wouldn’t confuse the two, unless it’s just the barest whiff. Sharper citrus up top but with the same sweet softness comprising 2/3 of the fragrance. I still really like it a lot, it gives me a craving for Cool Water when I wear it sometimes. A flanker with high ambroxen might be nice."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I didn't like the initial burst, way to sharp and sweet for my nose, but as it settles down, it turns into something very pleasant. The sage and patchouli notes are very good, somehow sporting. Performance was decent, I got roughly six hours on my skin. It isn't daring, it's certainly not adventurous, but it's very pleasant, definitely vibes of Legend Spirit, but performance is better."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Very generic but still smells good. It didn’t blow me away but the simplicity of the scent means I would reach for it a lot. It’s fresh, juicy and easy to wear. It would make the perfect dumb-reach daily fragrance for the coming summer months."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Very fresh, very juicy citrus notes off the top. Pretty aquatic to me, even tho there’s no aquatic notes. Love smelling it on the tester strip, it’s like a huge blast of freshness. Fragrance snobs won’t like it, but this would make a great gift for any man"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Lots of Pineapple and Freshness. Nothing offensive. Mass appealing and pretty much a dumb reach. If you own a bunch of bottles in your collection, this is something that you might never reach for since you might have something similar. Otherwise, wait until it hits the discounters as it's not worth Macys prices."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,The juniper and sage pop right away with the top notes. Keeps it very aromatic. Its fresh with a slight mature earthy tone. The dry down you get the vetiver touch with a not too strong patchouli. To me this is like a preppy mature young man's fragrance. I can see young ment wearing this at a yacht club . Which is very fitting for the polo brand in my opinion. I really don't find anything special with this but it's not bad. This is something that will appeal to many . If the notes are up your alley then I think it's a good blind buy. Everything is pretty balanced and not one note smacks you in the face. Performance is just ok. After about 3 hours it was a close scent.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It’s good. The reviewer before me nailed it— it’s equal parts MYSLF, Ralph’s Club, and Legend Spirit. I like all of those fragrances, and I like this one. It’s not groundbreaking at all, but relatively inoffensive in my opinion. I like this similarly to MYSLF, a bit more than Legend Spirit, and way more than Ralph’s Club.The opening is really nice— sweet and fruity. It dries down to a sort of generic freshness with some sweetness. For me, it’s a skin scent within 2 hours.Hard to go wrong with this one, so it could be a nice gift for someone, and it could easily be someone’s one fragrance. Easy dumb reach that leans more casual than formal. Wish the opening lasted longer or was more indicative of the fragrance that follows. 7.4/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It’s like a mix of ysl y ,Ralph’s club and legend spirit . Fresh blue out the shower deodorant fragrance . To be fair I kinda like it more that those fragrances mentioned 🤷🏻♂️I think it’s better blended and not 1 note gets overpowering. Would I pay retail ? $108 for 4.2 oz isn’tbad but once this hits discounters I’ll be buying"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is very good.Pineapple and bergamot combo that's incredibly pleasant. People are going to love this.It's been compared to YSL MyslF. I think they're different but I understand why. They both smell great, are mass appealing and can be worn every season and on every occasion. And isn't that what a regular customer wants?Now, for fragrance fans like us this may be seen as too safe and not challenging. But I'm a firm believer in only needing a few fragrances for a fully rounded collection and this could be your all rounder, dumb reach in your collection. We all need one.It reminds me of Invictus (the original) but much smoother.Good value too.One small negative however is that longevity isn't great. I'm getting about 4 hours with 5 sprays. But overspray this because it's not too expensive and not overwhelming.8/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Fresh and sweet, youthful in my opinion, tested today and loved the opening on paper but not so much on skin, enjoyed a lot more the drydown though. I don't consider it a bad fragrance, I think it goes in the direction of YSL Y edp and MYSLF with hints of Invictus, targets a younger audience and a trend for versatile and easy to wear scents. It's not expensive and the longevity & sillage are acceptable. Can be a bit of everything, fresh, sweet, tropical, shower gel, aromatic, masculine. Solid release from Ralph Lauren."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This is the best Polo in my opinion. The scent is balanced just right. I just wish it was a little cheaper but it will probably go on discounters pretty soon.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Cloyingly sweet yet most folks will probably love it. Inoffensive but not memorable. One of the stronger and longer lasting releases from Ralph Lauren. The dry down is reminiscent of Eros EDT on my skin. 6/10
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"best fragrance ever. I would trade my soul just for one sniff. Smells like my grandma's carcass mixed with goon juice.Smells like hitting the penjamin but more Sigma. pure bliss when this hits my nose, so much so that I release my goon juice at just a whiff."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,This smells just like Y Le Parfum and MYSLF... only difference is both of those last a lot longer than this.

Prada Luna Rossa Ocean EDP would kill this and was clearly some kind of inspiration for this. Considering the profile, current price, and competition. I have to say NO!!At $60 yeah, ok. But it’s brand new and they want $135. No way in hell it’s worth retail"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,yummy
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This is a cool, chic fougère fragrance that is equally suited for buttoned-down work situations, or for a fun Spring or Summer night with a date along the riverside. To me, it’s metropolitan and classy - silver high-rise buildings and sunshine. It is an eau de toilette, so it lasts maybe five hours on my skin and then I need to re-apply, but the lemon and bergamot interact nicely with the vetiver on me and give a cool interpretation to the oeuvre. It makes a lovely addition to my collection of fragrances, and has an understated, classy bottle design with a vintage twist and interpretation on the Polo bottle design in crisp white contrasted with dark, midnight blue. The urbanness of the fragrance, along with its citrusy and watery freshness anchored in the goldenrod and vetiver make this a fine Spring fragrance that the females in my circle enjoy and take notice of. Stuttgart, Geneva, Helsinki, and other modern cities come to mind when sampling this charming blend. I am glad I added this one to my cabinet. Good for daily wear and nights out."

Tested it all day and to be frank, I got 5-6 hoirs out of it. It doesnt project much, a little more than a arms length for 2 hours, after that it sits close to the skin.Its got a clean citrusy fruity opening, personally this is the best part. Once it begins to dry down, it smells like a fruit soap. In the deep dry down its mildly fruity.An easy fragrance to wear if your looking for something safe."

I’m a need of another good summer fragrance & this def fits the bill!! I like how the note of pineapple is nothing at all like Aventus. Although It’s a designer & not near as expensive as Aventus, The sweet pineapple to me is still better & this is a great take on a blue fragrance of which I usually do not gravitate towards! So like others have said on here, GOOD JOB POLO!!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I got this one in as a sample when I purchased Purple Label. As Ralph Lauren's newest fragrance, I was excited about what it could offer. Not much else to say with it being so new, so let's dig in;Scent:Opening is fruity, citrusy, and aromatic. The primary notes I get are pineapple, bergamot, lemon, and juniper. The strongest of the notes are the pineapple and bergamot. The bergamot is citrusy and clean, very typical of that note. The pineapple is juicy and sweet, not tart like the pineapple note I'm familiar with in Aventus (and its numerous clones). It's almost like what you would smell when opening canned pineapple, or fresh pre-packaged pineapple. This is followed by the juniper and lemon. The lemon helps to bolster the citrusy cleanliness brought on by the bergamot. The juniper is fresh and piney, again very typical of the note. The dry down is fruity, aromatic, and woody. The primary notes I get are pineapple, vetiver, juniper, and lemon. The strongest notes are the pineapple and vetiver. The pineapple note still carries the same sweet fruitiness from the opening while the vetiver has stepped up to provide a contrasting masculine woodiness. This is followed by the juniper and lemon, both with the same accords from the opening. Pineapple is very much the star in this fragrance.Performance:Initial projection is moderately strong, around 3 feet. Sillage is strong with an easily noticeable scent trail. After a few hours the projection was about arms length and there was still a noticeable scent trail. At the 8 hour mark the projection and sillage were largely unchanged, maybe just a tad lighter. Overall the fragrance lasted about 10 hours before it became a skin scent.When to wear:This is a spring/summer scent most suited for daytime wear. This would be a safe pick for the office as well, but isn't what I would choose for formal occasions or dates.Blind buy:If you like fresh and aromatic scents with a fruity twist (think YSL Y EDP, but less ""blue"") this is a safe blind buy for you.Final verdict:I went into this fragrance expecting it to be a fresh bomb similar to RL Blue, but it wasn't like that at all. Pineapple is the main note here, and shines from opening to dry down. The scent itself is very enjoyable in a mass-appealing way; everyone thought it smelled great on me. The performance is respectable as well, 10 hours is not what I was expecting. Overall a great casual scent to wear to the office and/or in the warmer months. I could see myself picking up a full bottle of this when it goes on sale at discounters.Scent: 8/10Longevity: 8/10Sillage: 6/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Pineapple bomb with “cinnamony” or “gingery” type fresh-spiceness to it. It smells like a tropical blue. Maybe think Club Parfum but with a strong pineapple note. Ralph Lauren seriously needs to get it together on the performance front. They’d be one of the best fragrance houses, period, if their fragrances had any respectable amount of performance. I understand this an EDT though. Just based on scent alone, however, this would be a fantastic summer and vacation frag - just be prepared to spray about 1.5-2 ml of it every time just to get it to show itself. Your bottle won’t last long."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Got a free sample at a yankees game. I really really like it. It’s like if u took every men’s fresh fragrance in a sephora and put it together

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Quite simply this is a nice fresh, masculine, mass appealing scent for warmer weather. It is what it is, and that’s fine!It starts with a nice blast of citrus and sweet pineapple that’s easy to pick up. It eventually dries down to a nice fresh woodsy scent. The typical Polo DNA is present in the background, but to my nose, not nearly as prominent as other releases.Longevity is okay, I get several hours on skin.Projection and sillage are on the low end for me, just a couple of hours maybe.This is an easy reach when you want to smell good but don’t want to think too hard. I like it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"To me, it smells like mixing Ultra Male, Armani Code, and Dylan Blue for the opening. Then it's like Blue de Chanel after a couple of hours. I enjoy it. No Sauvauge vibes to me. I reapply after 3 hours and it'll do well. I got a compliment outside, within arm reach of someone after driving in a convertible with plenty of air hitting me. It had been about 2 hours since i applied it when that happened.After 4.5 hours, it's a solid skin scent, though. If you get intimate later, it will get you a compliment as a skin scent, no doubt. and In the morning, still in bed, you can still smell it. But if you're looking for sillage and projection, reapply after every 3 hours (Which i feel is the case with most fragrances you can find at a department store.)1st hour, it will project well and leave sillage. All in all, it's a solid fragrance, but not a unicorn or anything. It's a loose ""Bleu"" fragrance with enough difference in the middle and base notes (that you can smell) that I'd say it's worth having in your collection. Reliable and inoffensive. Good smelling, no doubt. Clean, slightly fruity, and inviting."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,It's not a bad scent but very generic cologne smelling and inoffensive. Dumb reach for those occasions where you want to smell good but not be noticed for something unique. I get lots of bergamot up top with a herbaceous base throughout the life of the scent. I'm not noticing the pineapple. Similar scent to Lacoste L.12.12 Blanc Eau Fraîche
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I tested this today and immediately this struck me as Ralph Lauren’s answer to YSL MYSLF. Similar vibes, used for the same situations as a grab and go dumb reach. Polo 67 would make a solid starter fragrance for anyone and it’s already safe to say that they’ll sell loads of this stuff. It’s fresh, it’s a bit sweet (in a fruity way), it’s versatile, and it’s got modern mass appeal written all over it! The candied pineapple bubblegum accord really reminds me a lot of Abercrombie’s First Instinct Together which in itself is similar to Invictus Aqua so that youthful vibe is definitely present here. Overall it’s a nice release but given what I already have I would never reach for it if I had it since it would simply be too redundant."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Smelled this yesterday at the local Macy's. This offering can be summed up by simply saying: 'Made to sell bottles to mainstream consumers at the front of our fragrance department'. That is all.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,It’s beast mode on my skin and fits perfect with a polo shirt or one spray on the chest before heading to the gym. I get more of a PDM Percival type of vibe than some of the other scents mentioned here and received a few compliments at the mall after a few sprays on my hand. It was still projecting four hours after washing my hands….
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"This trend really has to stop. It seems like the last 10 years ( at least) every other fragrance is a take on Invictus/Aqua. Just another modern "" masculine"" candied sugary fruit scent. Absolutely nothing to set it apart from the crowd. Smells like a teenage boy at the jr high dance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Fresher and sporty take on Ralph’s club imo. Very casual. Easy grab and go for running errands and would be a good gym frag
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Just tested it at a Macy’s. I didn’t know anything about it other I’d never seen the bottle before, and it’s a nice bottle. All I got on the test strip was yet another generically fruity gourmand. It’s fine, but I was never a big fan of the trend, which is apparently still going strong. I didn’t stick it out long enough to see about the mid and base notes, but if you need another chewy gourmand to go with the newer Paco Rabannes and Jimmy Choos, Polo ‘67 has got you covered."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Nothing groundbreaking, which isn't a bad thing. I enjoy it and mostly pick up citruses with some hints of pineapple. Average longevity and sillage. I can see it being one of my ""grab and spray"" casual scents this Spring/Summer. The price point is reasonable, and I imagine you will be able to find it for less than retail at some point."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Initial reaction is “eh, it’s alright”. I wanted the pineapple to be strong and realistic, which is a tall order considering the brand, but I’m really only picking up the lemon, and it’s synthetic. The fruit has a candied feel to it, I definitely get the sage right away, juniper in the mid. I never noticed the rose nor the patchouli, and you really only smell a hint of vetiver as it becomes a skin scent.Opening is bright, citrus smell lasts a good hour, the whole fragrance gets about 5 hours total longevity. It’s not offensive, it’s not unique, it’s not… really much of anything. Just “alright”"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,It should be named „Polo 27” 😛
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"It isn't for me. The fruits are there, but it is overpowered by herbal/floral notes on my skin. The blend isn't that great, but I can see the mass appeal direction they are going.Update:Tried it again and now I kind of like it. I still am off put by the opening but once it settles, it is really nice. Tad sweet, fresh, has an almost smokey sense to it as well on me, which I enjoy."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,The most forgettable boring generic fragrance I’ve ever smelled.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Very great fragrance bought it as soon as i smelt it in store. Pineapple is very prominent in this fragrance. This fragrance has very good versatility. Starts as a spicy fresh sweet then turns in a sweet woody tone. It’s super mass appealing. Lasts a long time.. projection is moderate. Please pick it this super solid release from Ralph Lauren.The pineapple note really makes this fragrance smell “spicy” in the opening.8.5/10 This is a good signature scent. PICK IT UP!!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"really sweet and clean, ambroxan dominant, reminds me of invictus and ysl y edp."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,They should have named it polo 99 after Judge.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Received to test and find it very clean and fresh in the opening, the fruity notes come out in the heart. It’s not bad at all, smells familiar to other fragrances but not identical (or at least haven’t identified an identical one just yet). A little in the same lane as Versace The Dreamer, D&G Intenso.Really impressive performance for designer and for an edt, lasts 2-3x longer than the recent Tom Ford Grey Vetiver Parfum for sure and projects within arm’s length easily, probably up to 5-6ft.A little more spring/summer but I could easily see this being worn all year round."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Got this as a gift. It’s very Invictus-ish. Sweet amber woods, fruity, basically similar to most every other Sephora shelf men’s release since 2015 or so. Maybe a hint of something herbal, but it’s very, very derivative of Invictus and those types. Similar to the Valentino Green Stravaganza I reviewed recently but a bit stronger. That amberwood base is very, very common and it's clearly recognizable.Shares zero similarity to Aventus or Elysium. This is more of an Invictus-lite style scent. Loaded with cashmeran, amberwoods, ambroxan. Sweet, youthful, derivative.Longevity was strong, 6-8+ hours or so in testing. Projection was designer average at an hour+ being very noticeable. Smelled it on my jacket the next day very clearly.A 6.5/10. Fine if you don’t own this type but a bit of a waste otherwise. Good thing is Polo tends to be found at discounters at very fair prices and the quality here didn't seem much worse than the other scents in this style."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,Not bad at all!! Definitely get the fruitier elements compared to the original Polo Blue but not too sweet or as sweet as the newest Polo Red Parfum. I actually get a big similarity to Dior Sauvage with this one which is a proven DNA but this 67 puts its own spin on it. It really smells like the Sauvage Body Wash to me even more so than Sauvage itself ha overall a really solid release that some will really like but may underwhelm others. Definitely does not smell like Aventus or Elysium so stop that haha
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,don't bother guys... that HATERS are poor little people... they are not OLD MONEY like we are... and nothing suits better to old money people that POLO !!!!!!!

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Quite simply this is a nice fresh, masculine, mass appealing scent for warmer weather. It is what it is, and that’s fine!It starts with a nice blast of citrus and sweet pineapple that’s easy to pick up. It eventually dries down to a nice fresh woodsy scent. The typical Polo DNA is present in the background, but to my nose, not nearly as prominent as other releases.Longevity is okay, I get several hours on skin.Projection and sillage are on the low end for me, just a couple of hours maybe.This is an easy reach when you want to smell good but don’t want to think too hard. I like it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Another great addition from Ralph Lauren. It starts with a great, citrusy pineapple opening and sweetens up in the dry down, but not in an overbearing way. This has been my most complimented fragrance by far, and I've had it for only a month or so. Polo 67 is a very crowd-pleasing scent with compliments spanning from all age ranges. Some call it generic and I can understand that. It reminds me of YSL MYSLF in that there are no groundbreaking or out-of-the-box notes that could turn people away. That can be seen as ""generic"" or safe and that is entirely up to you. Personally, I think that it smells incredible and it is my new daily fragrance for the summer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"Polo 67 by Ralph Lauren starts off strong with a mix of bergamot, sage, and juniper, with vetiver quietly in the background. The fragrance opens fresh and green, giving you a straightforward and pleasant aroma.Lemon and pineapple are present but not as prominent as you might expect. The pineapple adds a slight sweetness, while the lemon gives a fresh touch, but neither overpowers the other notes.As it dries down, there’s a very subtle hint of rosehip that adds a soft floral nuance. This makes the scent feel a bit creamier and smoother as it settles.Overall, Polo 67 is a simple, creamy, floral woody citrus fragrance. It’s easy to wear, fresh, and doesn’t try to do too much, making it a good choice for everyday use"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Ralph-Lauren/Polo-67-90347.html,Polo 67 Ralph Lauren cologne - a new fragrance for men 2024,"I really wanted to like it and tried it on skin a couple of times. Unfortunately I cannot stand the pineapple note in any shape or form. 67 has got loads of ripe pineapple juice which is way too much for me. The opening is really nice , but the dry down is what kills the deal for me. It reminded me of Aventus only without the burnt wood smell. Not a safe blind buy."

On my skin, the cherry note was nice, but not that captivating, and it faded after a little while leaving with me with an 'okay' scent. Like: I wouldn't be mad if I was gifted this, but even then I'd probably end up wearing perfume I like more."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My signature scent right now! I really love the tart cherry opening and can definitely sense the citrus/madarine when i first spray it as well. One thing is that sometimes it does have a slight ""play-doh"" vibe to it but generally i love it, much more than the original black opium which i found to be cloying and heavy. Unnlike the og black opium, i can barely smell the coffee note, since i think the vanilla overpowers it a little. As it settles down, the vanilla REALLY pushes through but i think a little bit of the citrus still lasts. Honestly the sillage isn't amazing but i don't really mind since i'm a student, so something subtler is my preference and the longevity is actually pretty good for me, it lasts a good 6-7 hours so overall a 9.5/10 (0.5 subtracted for being a little unreliable sometimes)"

It starts off with that fruity sour cherry and as that fades it turns into this soft sweet warm vanilla. Its not overpowering. It is just soft and snuggly smelling to me. It's nothing out of this world but it's exactly what I like. I can smell it on my skin still by the end of the night.

Is it a fragrance or some drink I don't know! But I don't like it that much and don't get the hype. It is unisex, more masculine. I don't like whole Black Opium line because of the coffee note. Without it I think this would be love for me. Who know maybe it grows on me."

Surprised to find out no almond notes. Not just another Lost Cherry imitator but something different. I wouldn't have guessed cherry if I didn't know, it's almost apple-like. Scrumptious. Wish it lasted longer and was a bit stronger though."

Even though I’m not a fan of Black Opium, this one smells superb. Interestingly, many people who dislike Black Opium also find this fragrance appealing—definitely worth a try!The cherry note reminds me of Carolina Herrera’s Very Good Girl, but this one feels more mature due to its subtle incense-like quality.As it dries down, the cherry scent fades, revealing a blend of vanilla, coffee, and a hint of cherry.To sum up, it would be great perfume in autumn/winter, especially for red berry scent lovers."

But wow, this is beautiful! On initial spray, I was unimpressed, but it was the dry down that made my eyes roll to the back of my head.There is something in here that smells almond-like, I’m assuming it’s the patchouli and/or the coffee? Anyway, they perfectly balance the cherry note and don’t allow it to overpower the other notes in the fragrance, which I always find in most cherry scents.I do think the black opium dna is present (which I’m a huge fan of and BO was my signature for a long time) but it’s still different enough to my nose. Needless to say, I bought a full bottle."

Think about falling into a pot with frozen cherries, yes that’s the experience. Smelling it from the cap you get the mixed scent of cherries and florals but on the skin the cherries fuse with the citrusy note and you start smelling like a candy, quite sweet. Not a sugary smell tho just the cherry itself is sweet. For anyone who loves cherries this is a fragrance I recommend. Very vampy and a bit dark, I love it."

I've been looking for a perfume that's sexy without being too heavy, mature, or spicy, and feminine without going so hard on the florals; and I found it with this one. I never really liked cherry perfumes either but I think the vanilla and coffee notes in this really balance it out well. There are very few perfumes that I wanted to buy and completely fell in love with after just one smell and this is one of them."

Either it was too synthetic smelling or a cherry cough syrup thing going on… I felt disappointed.Until I smelled this. It’s a sexy cherry blended so well with a little of the OG DNA. It’s definitely easier on the nose and isn’t a scent you wear to fill any room you walk into. This sits close to the skin, lasts days on clothing. Anytime anyone hugs me, they comment on how good I smell.It’s odd but this is what I want to smell like when I’m being intimate. Sexy, sweet, powdery, clean, yet deep and intoxicating. That’s what this perfume is like for me. In the summer, it’s very seductive as it just melts into your skin and I feel goes well when you sweat… in the winter it’s cozy yet fresh.

I honestly haven't met a version of Black Opium that I didn't like, so if you hate the OG, just know that and take my review with a grain of salt, haha. The ones I've smelled so far are OG, Extreme, Le Parfum, Illicit Green, and Over Red. I have a small clone of Neon on the way from Andromeda's Moon, so will see how I feel about that, as her clones tend to be pretty spot on.For now, Le Parfum remains my favorite, and the full bottle I most want. Thinking about asking for it for Xmas. This just might come second, though, and is a great choice if you want to jump on the cherry trend with a perfect cozy gourmand for the upcoming seasons. I don't especially care what's trending, if anything I'd rather NOT smell like everyone else, but I do enjoy a nice cherry if not medicinal or too simple. It's true that once it wears for awhile it's not terribly different from regular degular Black Opium, but again, for me that isn't a bad thing, lol. As cherry perfumes go, my favorite remains Estee Lauder Modern Muse Le Rouge Gloss, but since it's discontinued, this is a good option!"

It is the only one I've purchased (and kept) a full bottle of.Even though Over Red isn't a bad fragrance (it's a solid choice if you love the OG), I will be decluttering this from my collection."

I noticed the vanilla is very similar, but I went with this one because smelling it feels like it gives me a hug, meanwhile Victory Elixir made me happy, but I have Noir Extreme for that.My favorite in the Black Opium line!"

The cherry is definitely there for me as it dries down but it's kind of understated. It's not a juicy, fruity cherry like in Cherry Ambition or Lovefest Burning Cherry, instead it's like cherry vanilla coke with a hint of florals and coffee. It's gourmand, but sexy and not too young or food-like. I love this for nights out in the fall and winter."

On the paper tester it smells amazing, sweet and rich but as soon as I spray it on my skin it turns into this sort of biscuit smell, sweet but a bit off-putting, had the same experience as when I had a bottle of Pink Sugar.It must be my skin chemistry, which is a shame, but I do not detect the cherry note on paper or skin which is a bit strange.I can see why people like this and it's a shame I cant wear it! I believe it is a bit more approachable than Black Opium, a bit more of a crowd-pleaser, It is definitely miles away from the original Opium.

This one is so amazing, it truly contrasts blackness with redness. Black fog covering the red nature of the scent. The redness is fruity, the blackness incensy. For a short time I felt something dusty, which ruined Black Opium to me, but it turned into a coffee note quickly. It was radiating from my wrist for a long time and I non stop felt the need to inhale this gorgeous scent. I want it.Now they fixed Black Opium starting with Extreme version. I am afraid I also like the Le parfum."

The coffee is ok. Dry down is pleasant. I smell apples, too sweet. Doesn't stink up the place. Totally bearable, I think I will use up the sample. Edit: Really not bad"

The cherry really stands out on my skin and is the most prominent note. I personally don’t get the coffee at all. It’s not particularly cough syrup I get that many others claim it smells, more like a dark chocolate covered cherry candy. It’s sweet yet intoxicating, and although very candy-like, there’s a layer of mystery to it. I keep getting whiffs of cherry everywhere I go, so if you’re looking for a cherry fragrance that projects, I highly recommend this. To my nose it smells like if Hibiscus Mahajad and Born In Roma Stravaganza were combined (with an added touch of cherry of course). Definitely a date night worthy fragrance."

Top/mid reminds me briefly of Black Perfecto by La Petite Robe Noire Guerlain, which is a cherry frag I like. Over Red is similar to OG Black Opium but the dry down has more Patchouli and less coffee to me. The dry down maybe closer to the Illicit Green flanker, but I found the coffee in Illicit Green to be kind of burnt and bitter. May revisit BO Over Red in cooler weather and compare to the samples I have of the BO flankers Intense and Nuit Blanche - if memory serves, I liked those better than the OG as I thought they were sweeter and smoother. I find the OG Black Opium easy to wear, but I've worn it sporadically for so long it's become too familiar and a bit boring."

I could absolutely see the quality in Le Parfum, but I always felt as though it was missing something for me. What it was missing, I realized after trying Over Red, was that tang of fruit that pops off my skin and keeps everything from being too soft and golden-sweet. Over Red is just what I wanted, and dang is it potent! I use a light hand and I catch whiffs of it all day. Drinkably good."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is Black Forest Cake in a bottle. Smells like eating maraschino cherry syrup with dark chocolate shavings while drinking a rich cup of espresso coffee. Its well-balanced and not overly sweet. The cherry note sits right above the vanilla and coffee accords. This is a perfume made for women, but men can still rock this as it doesn't lean too feminine. So this is a worthy addition to your collection.It has the same DNA as the Black Opium EDP and Le Parfum. The EDP has the signature coffee note but has a more floral dry down (which leans more feminine). While Le Parfum ""is the most intense and warm interpretation of the original Black Opium perfume"" according to brand's description.This is a beautiful gourmand concoction that's similar to Kayali Vanilla 28 and Candy Rock Sugar.Since Black Opium Over Red smells edible, sweet, and warm it is best worn on cool days or in an airconditioned environment.Inoffensive, so its office safe. Lasts for hours on shirt, less on skin. Moderate projection and sillage. ❤️"

It took me a while to adjust to the sweetness in this perfume in the beginning. It starts off a bit syrupy in the opening that is reminiscent to the dark maraschino cherries used in cocktails. A couple minutes in, the coffee and vanilla come out to play and the blend of cherry, coffee, and vanilla surround you creating a small scent bubble for about 4 hours. It could be a bit medicinal in the opening, but it works. Further in the dry down, the vanilla takes over and it is sweet, similar to the way other black opium perfumes dry down. Moderate longevity and projection. Kinda wish it lasted longer.3 Month Masceration Update: It is even better. The vanilla is all around enveloping and the coffee and cherry sit inside it. The medicinal cherry scent is gone. Warm, intoxicating, and a touch gourmand. 9/10 nowIn comparison, my current favorite cherry perfume is Cherry Smoke from TF (less sweet, balanced so well with the smoky leather note, but lacking longevity and wildly overpriced). Over Red is definitely more feminine and sexy, yet surprisingly unique imo. 7/10"

Lost Cherry and Lovefest Burning Cherry are a deep, smoky cherry that is somehow just *not it* for me. They're both too smoky, and too realistic at the same time. Others like Midnight Fantasy and Party Love are somehow too juicy and juvenile for me. I haven't yet found any that are too medicinal for my taste.This delicious concoction somehow manages to satisfy my sweet tooth without making me feel like I smell like a teenager. I think it's the florals and green mandarin, and maybe the fact that the cherry seems a little powdery, but in a good way.Compared to the original Black Opium, this seems quite different to me, even apart from the cherry note. The vanilla here is more prominent and deep, and the florals seem different somehow. They're still white florals, but not the jasmine and orange blossom combo I'm used to. Maybe it's the tea that changes things up. I still can't smell the coffee.At any rate, I love her. My only problem is that she doesn't last more that 3 or 4 hours on my skin.I have a comparison of several BO flankers in my review of Black Opium EDP for anyone who is interested.

To really detect the coffee note, I have to reallllyy dig my nose into my wrist. What I predominantly notice is a very powdery cherry (???) and orange blossom. The cherry note, in particular, takes me back to when I was eight years old and had braces put on for the first time. After the procedure, I was given a strawberry-flavored Lip Rageous Lip Balm, and Over Red smells exactly like that. While it's not a bad fragrance, it's not something I would wear daily.

I see many complaints regarding its longevity. I find on me it lasts for well over 6 hours, it's just that it is more of a skin scent.EDIT: it is very sweet but I don't mind it at all.

Never smelled the OG Black Opium before. My first introduction to it is this flanker. Let’s see how it goes. My reaction is real-time:Okay, so it starts off like cherry Kool Aid—light, refreshing and playful. It also has a cherry Chapstick vibe.It's settling down, and I can feel the coffee note kicking in, although it’s performing like chocolate. I’m all for it.The coffee note is becoming more pronounced, but it's not overpowering. It’s a harmonious blend of the residual cherry, something spicy, and I do smell some muskiness from the jasmine. I don’t know yet how to distinguish the orange blossom note, but it seems that most perfumes I like have it, and this one has it too. For a gourmand, this is staying light and not heavy, which I’m assuming is due to the green mandarin.Omigosh, this is beautiful. I never thought I would be into cherry-based fragrances, but here I am. This is truly eye-opening. I wanted something to wear to the theatre because I’ll be on a date and we’ll be watching a mystery/thriller film. I got this as a sample, so I figured this would fit the mood.My hunch was verified: this is mysterious, sexy and delicious. My mouth is watering, but it’s not an overly sweet gourmand that I feel like I’m going to have cavities. It feels clean, non-sticky (wow, how was it able to do that with the coffee and vanilla notes?) and well-balanced.Everyone, I’m in love with this scent. It’s exactly what I’ve been craving for, for the last few days. As someone with a collection of mostly floral and citrusy fragrances with pink bottles, I’m really beginning to enjoy gourmand notes and be curious of deeper scent profiles. I feel like a Pokémon that just evolved. My taste in fragrances is expanding. I have mostly this to thank. Considering buying a bottle of this and delving more into the Black Opium collection."

I am usually no fan of cherry scents, but this one is great! It’s creamy, sensual and has a mysterious vibe to it. The cherry is sweet but not sickening. It has almost a candy feel to it, but in a good way. I can smell the coffee too, but it’s very soft. On my skin, it’s mostly cherry and vanilla but I am not complaining, it’s a beautiful scent. Perfect for date nights."

I put some on a card and took it home to see if I'd change my mind after a while but nope, still very medicinal. Not a safe safe blind buy."

Cherry syrupy scent with a hint of coffee to uplift the overly sweet and end note of patchouli giving the cozy and spicy enough to just make her unique but still got that black opium heiress in her. I never love cherry note until YSL has shown me how to love her right! 😍❤️
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,To me it smells exactly like Kayali Burning Cherry Love Fest and Tom Ford Lost Cherry. Maybe it's a bit fresher and the first notes remind me of cherries with marzipan but the drydown is just the same.

Glossy, almond-shaped burgundy nails. Berry-stained lipstick. A waterfall of glossy, dark hair sweeping over a bombshell figure adorned in a black satin dress. She smells of amarena cherries, madagascar vanilla, freshly brewed coffee, and something vaguely medicinal you can't quite put your finger on. This perfume is entrancingly sweet, decadent, and syrupy."

That said buying a full bottle doesn't cross my mind, there is a strong commercial / drugstore perfume feel to it. Nice though!"

I’m wearing it on a warm night and it smells very pretty. In the drydown, I get a somewhat powdery cherry-vanilla-coffee, with black tea. Cherry is stronger in the opening and is softer in the drydown though still perceptible. Not a tart or juicy cherry dominant scent if that’s what you’re after. It’s not too sweet or too heavy (I didn’t overspray it). Good for all year round, though it’s not for very hot weather, and it’s not dense enough for very cold weather. It doesn’t wow me, but it does smell very nice. Moderate longevity and sillage. I kind of want it but I’ll have to sample it again. I’m not a fan of the Black Opium line except for this flanker and the discontinued Nuit Blanche flanker. Black Opium Le Parfum is very beautiful, but not really my style."

Zero coffee and patchouli or orange blossom. Very smooth, feminine, modern perfume. But l can’t call this a cherry perfume. In this formulation is cherry only like sweetener. This is Skittles like perfume with smoky sheerness form black tea. For me the best Black Opium, because is not sharp and too heavy. I also love the sheer dark red bottle. It match the scent perfectly."

I thought the Opium line is a night out scent, but this one dry down to a comforting Vanilla scent. It's perfect for a cozy dinner date. I don't find it boozy enough to be called a night out scent.If you don't care much about the initial Cherry opening, I highly recommend To Be Born to Shine by Police. It's the exact same comforting Vanilla. This is not complex like the original Opium. I didn't get much Coffee in this one.I personally love the dry down of To Be Born to Shine by Police more. I'm a sucker for Police fragrances, so excuse my biased opinion. Not that I don't love Black Opium, I did have the original in the past, but none of the flankers released recently gave me the Opium vibe. They could've added cherry cola in the dry down to make this one more interesting."

I was soooo hoping not to like Black Opium Red. Unfortunately that juicy, maraschino cherry on top note did something to my skin it doesnt seem to do with other people...it LASTED. Cherries over the top gorgeous, thicc vanilla (yes I used two c's), slightly slutty, high end synthetic gourmand sent straight from heaven. Its a bit much but in the very best possible way. I'm not a fan of excessive sweetness unless there is a bigger picture and here the bigger picture is a sexed up, slightly boozy Cherry Garcia ice cream (but better). I haven't smelled the BO le partum which I'm hoping and praying not to love as I already have 2 gorgeous YSL Libre flankers that I still can't decide upon and causes such a stress to decide which one. I really don't want the same can't decide which I like more experience with BO. 9/10 fragrance."

I never smelled coffee in neither Black Opium, Black Opium le Parfum, the neon-green Black Opium nor, now, the Black Opium over-red. but that is something amnostic with the coffee... You certainly smell an onslaught of cherry, just as I like my perfumes to be. Rather than Orange Blossom I smell the jasmine immediately. I think in coordination with the orange blossom. it is a heavy and heady perfume, bringing back memories to Opium, Giorgio, Poison, Boudoir and even Mahora. the Cherry and Vanilla are the main course. it certainly isn't gone after 30 minutes. hours later it is still lingering. lovely lovely lovely. the notes are well macerated to give you a power experience. Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium Over Red6 hours in and I can easily detect the cherry, vanilla, the white flowers and patchouli.the green neon Black Opium is called 'Illicit Green'. I love them all."

I'm obsessed, it's like black opium if it was a lighter day perfume. The scent is very nostalgic but isn't basic or too simple. Personally I always stick by vanilla perfumes but I can never find one that has the sexiness and brightness of a floral. But this I feel encapsulates both perfectly! I am in love!"

I adore this opening even though it’s a bit too sweet for me. It changes quite rapidly and after a while I’m getting slightly imbalanced mix of synthetic coffee and white flowers. It’s fun, but it’s not a keeper…Btw I’m not a fan of any other Black Opium flankers at all :)Follow me on IG: scent.guide"

My first impression was that it reminded me of freeze dried strawberries and powdered sugar.It's a sweet cherry scent, opening is fruity then dries down a little powdery as an almost lactonic vanilla emerges. I'm not getting any coffee or anything green. Maybe there's some jasmine, but most of all I get cherry and vanilla. It doesn't last long though."

I’m in search for a new perfume to buyIf anyone could help me which one is sexier between black opium original and black opium over red ? I prefer fruity perfume but I know that black opium original is one of the best sellers so I’m wondering. One of my favorite perfumes until now is So Scandal by Jean Paul Gaultier and it’s a fruity scent (raspberry). Thanks for answering me 🙏🏻🙏🏻
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Nasty!!! Smells like smoky B.O and cherries. I was so disappointed because black opium is nice enough and I thought it would be nice to have that scent with cherries in it. Instead this smells horrible. Total pass :(
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Nice take on the OG. IMO makes it more wearable daily and seems like a nice scent for dates. For me it's cherry and warm instant coffee at the beginning, then it turns florae with the Jasmine and a musky neroli, plus some candy-like vanilla sweetness.On the drydown it's one of this smells I can't stop smelling on my wrist. I feel I like it the more I wear it."

I love Black Opium and I was looking for a cherry fragrance for ages and this seemed like a good combo. I'm wearing it today for the first time and I have to admit I like it. I used a generous amount of sprays in the morning and I still smell the cherry note in the afternoon. It has that Opium coffee/vanilla base but it's a nice addition to the line. Longevity seems to be good so far, projection moderate, I prefer stronger fragrances and this seems to be weaker than the original but I don't mind re-spraying."

It's a sweet cherry that's not too in-your-face or medicinal. Combined with the coffee and vanilla note, it really makes toned down so it's not too nauseatingly cherry. I'm not a huge fan of the powdery patchouli, but I think in the fall or winter it will be less cloying. I'm excited for colder weather to wear it! I also think it will be nice to layer with vanilla lotions to make it more gourmand."

Soft, cushy version. To me it is a bit unnecessary flanker as already have been released so many and more distinctive in some aspects."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The initial opening of this scent is very jammy, syrupy, and somewhat medical ""cherry"" flavor. On dry down it transforms beautifully on my skin, the vanilla, jasmine, and patchouli create a warm cozy scent with cherry trace, with just enough powdery and spicy depth. I'm surprised I don't see more comments about how disappointing the sillage and longevity of this fragrance is! This fragrance becomes a skin scent almost immediately, and the fragrance only lasts about 3 hours before disappearing completely off my skin. I've been having to reapply it 3-4 times a day whereas the OG black opium can last me 6+ hours off a single spray."

Just a bunch of random sweet florals, vanilla, patchouli, coffee mixed together in the worst way possible. My boyfriend once said that the original smells like somebody ate a bunch of really sweet food and puked it out, it smells like very sweet puke and honestly I have to agree. This one smells just like that except with the added cherry. It honestly reminds me of one of my fav. perfumes Pink Sugar Berry Blast except Black opium is the even trashier sister. It’s pink sugar berry blast after a night of intense partying, hooking up with strangers, throwing up and doing more shots after and walking with heels in your hands.Honestly I think if I caught a whiff of this on somebody else I would think it smells nice but smelling it up close on my hand makes me gag a bit.It’s probably a nice fragrance to wear on a night out and you’ll probably get complimented by a lot of males but that’s it. There’s nothing deep or original about this perfume and that’s ok, I just think the Black Opium range is getting a bit boring."

Seven hours later and I can smell the vanilla, but never got a cherry note. One spray between two wrists, and it's stuck around until now. Decent sillage; I smell it every time my arms pass my face and I'm sure it'd be more powerful with more sprays, unlike my OG Black Opium which seems to need to be applied in just the right places and with a moisturiser underneath it to have real projection.

It’s still a very nice perfume, but it seems a bit more mellow / less long lasting than the original, and it’s also a tad too sweet to my taste.If I hadn’t been so familiar with the original I might’ve been more impressed, but I doubt it would’ve been a “run over to the store NOW” kind of scent for me in that case either.I’d recommended it to people who might be put off by the powerful smell of the original Black Opium perfume, and those who enjoy wearing slightly sweeter (gentle but not candy-sweet type) perfumes."

I love the OG Black Opium (call me basic). I also love, like LOVE, cherry (I adore Tom Ford's Cherry Smoke and Lost Cherry, and Kayali's Burning Cherry). How could it possibly go wrong?But go wrong, it did. Everything smelled pretty nice on the card but something went awry on my skin and I can barely explain the pungent stench it morphed into. Within 30 minutes of applying, I went to sniff my wrist and was met with the awful aroma of halitosis. I once had a terrible tonsil infection and THAT was the smell I was getting. I had to rush to the bathroom to scrub it off, lest I be rushed to the ER for an urgent tonsillectomy! This is not the vibe I am seeking in a personal fragrance.I'm sure my reaction is unusual but it sure was powerful!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I was so excited and I wanted to love it. I don’t dislike it, but the initial spray was Black Opium with gorgeous cherry, just as it says on the tin. Sadly, in no time the cherry was gone and I essentially had a sample of the original. So I do like it, but I’m going to experiment with the original and some of my existing cherry fragrances to see if I can get a better result (on myself - if this cherry works on you, congratulations)."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Fantastic! I'm a fan of all cherry fragrances . I won't buy the female ones but I'll definitely appreciate them. This one smells fantastic . It smells like dark black cherry slightly natural and synthetic then it dries down to a more hard candy scent, but not too sweet. The black tea, coffee and vanilla really bright down to a little earthy tone that balances it out. It ha enough spice to where a man could layer it and really masculine it up. But on its own it's fantastic. I think I'll be getting this for the gf one day"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I'm a little heartbroken - I like black opium, I LOVE cherry scents, so this seemed to be like a dream for me when I found out about it. Tried it in the store and it was the most intoxicating thing ever. I thought wow, this flanker is actually better than the original. Was really expecting this to become my favourite fragrance. Finally bought a bottle and... where is the lasting power? It still smells nice on first spray, cherry, coffee and vanilla, but it almost seems watered down, it's like an EDT and that parfum punch is just missing... after an hour or two it's gone. Will wear for the rest of the week to update and see if my opinion changes (I hope so given how much money I spent on this) but I sadly have to say I am let down. I'd probably suggest to anyone who likes how this smells in store, to buy a sample and try that out for a few days before committing."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This will make you smell like a vanilla cherry cake in a good way. My bf rarely comments my perfumes but he said that the minute he stepped in the house he wondered if i made some desert with vanilla. Cherry note is present in about half an hour then it disappears and i can feel just gournament vanilla with a hint of coffee. Still nice.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I think I should jump for joy so many people love this version - more Opium Black Le Parfum for me :)This is yet another cherry note fragrance although well done. Just not to my taste.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I absolutely can’t stand original and Le Parfum Black Opium, so I was not going to smell this one. But I got a little mini bottle on hand and decided to try it out before giving it to someone else.. and OMG. I love it! I don’t like coffee note in the original and I don’t like too strong cherry note as in Lost Cherry or Burning Cherry… but this is a masterpiece. I love the sweet vanilla, mandarin and orange blossom - my favourite notes. There is just a hint of cherry and coffee - just perfect for me. I ordered a bottle already, so excited! The longevity is not the best, I have to admit. It stays strong for 1-2 hours, then fades and becomes more soft for the next 3-4 hours and then I barely smell anything. Lasts longer on clothes."

IN LOVE! Such a beautiful creamy sweet vanilla bomb with a hint of cherry 🍒 (would not consider this a cherry fragrance). It's more like le parfum, with no coffee and a touch of cherry syrup. The right amount of cherry and I'm obsessed."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Tried in the Sephora and... grape jello?
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Just received a tester the other day. Initial spray is heavy on the cherry, very dense and sweet as any others have noted. It blends pretty quickly for me into the jasmine and vanilla, before arriving on what to me smells of vanilla and patchouli on dry down.The initial cherry may smell extremely synthetic and cough syrupy on initial spray, but immediately get better as it dries. This one was a love! Perfect for nights or cold, winter weather."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Sampled this fragrance while shopping around for a perfume to buy as a gift. The opening is what you expect: A decent hit of cherry against a slightly cloying, but pleasingly chocolatey background.After around four hours though, the cherry note seems to disappear - leaving you with a very strange scent that smells like chocolate against a backdrop of…cardboard?Sadly, as Tom Ford aficionados know, it’s difficult to find a cherry scent where the cherry scent has staying power. This fragrance is no exception."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I am on the team that calls Over Red the best YSL Opium flanker yet. I had tested several other flankers and the original and this is the best one so far. I find this to be dense and syrupy. May be too much for those who are sensitive to sweet dense smells, but on my very cool skin this is not too dense or too sweet at all. I also agree that while maintaining the original Black Opium DNA, Over Red substantially differs from others. While I am not a huge fan of the Black Opium line, I do enjoy this one and recommend trying it out."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"IMO this is the best Black Opium flanker. Le Parfum is also good, but this one just takes the cake. Most of the other flankers smell basically the same as the original, but this one is different. This has such a warm, sweet, cherry coffee scent. It's a bit less heavy than the others and more sweet. The cherry note doesn't linger longer than an hour, but I find that layering this with Cherry Ambition by The 7 Virtues makes the cherry really stand out. If you have both and want to amp up the cherry in this, try layering the two.This has pretty good longevity and sillage on me. I usually respray once or twice after 5-6 hours though."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,So Today I have finally tried out YSL Black Opium Over Red. It is a syrupy sweet cherry jam with vanilla and coffee. Projection is very good. But not sure if I like it...:-/ My favourite ones are original one and Le Parfum version.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Sweet chocolate cherry coffee. The initial spray is very deep sexy sweet, unfortunately the drydown gets much sweeter and the coffee fades. The drydown turns into just straight chocolate cherry, smells like a candy bar. Too sweet for my personal taste but for people who like delicious sweet food-type gourmands it's perfect."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The OG Black Opium was on my want list for a long time, but I prefer a bit more niche fragrances, so I was so exited when this came out.I can smell the coffee and vanilla, not that much the cherry.It’s a very nice fragrance, only thing that is slightly bothering me is that it fades quickly on me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a thick, juicy, full-bodied in your face sweet cherry fragrance! My first impression is traditional Black Opium with a cherry note that practically slaps you in the face. It's delicious, sexy and mysterious.The cherry note kind-of dissipates after the dry down and leaves the original Black Opium scent behind which I'm ok with. It projects like crazy so be careful not to overspray.If you love cherry or gourmands you will LOVE this!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This starts off as a juicy cherry but later dries down to a Cherry coke / Dr.pepper scent.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I wore an excessive amount of this when I tested it at Ulta last night. I sprayed it on skin and clothes, and the sillage was intense. I can still smell it in my hair today.I do not care for the original Black Opium, as it is just purely linear, overly sweet coffee on me.This one I love! It has a bit more going on. But it is also very literal black coffee PLUS cherry, and I'm trying to decide whether or not I am okay with this, lol.Generally, what I'm getting is a strong black coffee, cherry, vanilla, and some sweet licorice. Who knew there were any florals involved? Haha.I could probably spray 7th Virtue's Cherry Ambition on me, and then spill an espresso shot down my shirt and I'd get a similar result as Over Red. I'd rather not spill coffee on myself, of course.But I do really love Over Red, and that dark cherry red bottle is simply GORGEOUS to look at. I could own it for the bottle alone. Super sweet gourmand, long-lasting, projects like a beast."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Finally a cherry that doesn't repulse me! To me, Over Red is like a sleeker Black Opium with a cherry fruitiness that somehow is not quite as sweet as the original. The bottle kinda looks exactly how it smells. A bit of a glowing fruity black opium, and still of course a night time fragrance. Maybe even classier than Black Opium. If Black Opium gives me a fuzzy cloudy feeling, Over Red has a smoother top layer, but still definitely has the original Black Opium DNA, like its loud and clear to me. It's mainly cherry and vanilla to me with some coffee, maybe slight patchouli or something else green like the tea or the orange blossom?Nothing this strong is work safe, but I believe it's a safer option than the original. Like if i were going to a night time event with work colleagues, I could see myself wearing this. It's fun and daring but still respectful and classy.Edit: I ended up buying it after testing it again. Just can't get it out of my mind. The dry down is heaven to me! I never thought if go for a flanker over the original (I've been considering buying black opium edp for 2 years), but this it for me! I said it's a night time scent but I am sure going to be wearing this a lot this autumn and winter, even during the day."

Nothing dark. Poorly executed.Reminiscent of a play doh synthetic cherry candle. Or a cherry gloss, but the cheap ones.It’s not bad but it’s overseen and lacks personality. I would not wear it. Can get extremely syrupy and cloying."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My favourite Black Opium flanker! This is just a great everyday perfume. Perfect for most weather, could be cloying in the height of summer. The cherry is beautiful amd sweet, not overly so. The vanilla and coffee sits in the back to support the cherry. The white florals thankfully don't play a big role here, the BO white florals come of sharp amd screechy to me. I don't get mandarin, tea or patchouli.In terms of similarities to other flankers, it's closest to the Le Parfum version but not as heavy. I have a few cherry fragrances but this one is different again. I absolutely love it. I got a sample and then bought a full size. Prior to this Floral Shock was my most worn BO flanker as it was office appropriate. But the Over Red has taken it's place and I will declutter Floral Shock.The lasting power is moderate. I get wiffs off it throughout the day but it does fade quite noticeably after 6 hours or so.I think this will develop more as the bottle sits amd last longer and become deeper. Looking forward to what this will smell like in another 6 months."

The cherry note is very prominent. I love the og but I’m not sure about this one . The dry down is sweet . The cherry is too medicinal for my taste .
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This version is similar to the OG, but has hints of cherry and a darker coffee note. It reminds me a little of sipping an after-dinner fine roasted coffee, accompanied by a cherry brandy. Absolutely delicious - and a delight to the senses! Even though a 'dark' perfume, it is freshened by the cherry and mandarin notes to make it suitable for springtime. Next week I'm going on a trip to Florence - I may well purchase Black Opium Over Red to enjoy there! ❤️"

But, I am going to let this one macerate in a dark, cool place and after a few weeks I'll see if it has developed more personality. The main drawback for me is the cherry is a little harsh at first, and it doesn't last very long to me. It dries down to something very similar to Le Parfum, not as sweet, almost a chocolate/coffee/vanilla with a hint of cherry after a few hours.If it comes together better after it sits for a while I'll certainly update this review. But for now, it's not on the buy again list.I would definitely encourage you to try this one before you buy. Purchased from: Sephora"

It's enjoyable enough. I wouldn't say that anyone that owns Black Opium (or any of most of its flankers) needs it, but if I were looking for a single version to buy, this would be a contender. It's sweet, warm, and cozy."

Delicious!"

I dislike the original BO, but I find this flanker soooo delicious and fun! Especially the first 30 mins is dreamy! The scent is identical to the note layout above. On my skin, pachouli projects quite strongly, although not unpleasantly. Delicious cherry vanilla coffee convo at the backdrop of beautiful white florals. It’s not super unique, but I’ll get a full bottle when the price is right."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is really cute! I'll start off by saying I don't think there's a Black Opium flanker I don't like except for Le Parfum (which smells rubbery to me). Cherry was very hyped last year, but it has not been my favourite note because a lot of the time it ends up smelling like cough syrup (eg. TF Lost Cherry and its dupes). But this is a very nice one. It's more like a sweet cherry candy. The vanilla really complements the cherry note and ensures it doesn't turn medicinal.For me, I do get more of the cherry in the opening, and by the time it dries down there's definitely a hint of cherry but the vanilla sweetness takes over, and there's a slightly smoky vibe. I don't get the coffee (or the tea) in this one - it's pretty much just cherry, vanilla and white florals. And I really enjoy it! It's still super hot and humid where I live so not the best weather for it, but not bad either. I'm actually surprised to say that while this is more of a cold weather scent, it actually goes well in the heat as well. Performance is also better than expected. It's quite present for about 4-6 hours, then after that it becomes a skin scent, but I can smell it for 10+ hours, even on a hot, humid day! It outlasts the vast majority of other scents for me. This is a great flanker in my opinion.EDIT: I just want to add that the atomiser on this bottle is excellent, especially compared to the other BO bottles in my collection. This one sprays out a lot, but it's a super fine mist that covers a lot of area. Very impressed! Love the packaging overall - it's beautiful. Am glad we can actually see through the bottle this time because I hate not knowing how much I have left."

I haven't smelled the entire Black Opium line, actually I've only smelled Black Opium Extreme, but I really liked that one and this reminds me of it. The Black Opium DNA is very distinctive and recognizable. I really like this fragrance, I think it smells amazing. It's pretty base heavy because I mainly pick up the base notes of vanilla, coffee and patchouli. There's also a freshness from the florals of jasmine and orange blossom throughout the opening and mid. The top notes of cherry and mandarin are apparent in the opening but are fleeting and don't stick around for long. I sprayed the tester strip a few days ago, and it's still strong and projecting. I had sprayed about 6 different tester strips of different fragrances, put them in the same room, and this one was standing out over the others and commanding the attention.I guess if the Black Opium fragrances smell very similar, I'd just get the one with the best performance which is also probably cheaper on the grey market. I haven't smelled them all to know for sure they all smell similar, but I think Over Red smells similar to the only other one I've smelled in Black Opium Extreme and there's 8 Black Opiums ranked ahead of that one in the ""reminds me of"" section, so..."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"💫Sotd: Black Opium Over Red (2024)💫Top notes are Cherry and Green Mandarin; middle notes are Jasmine, Orange Blossom and Black Tea; base notes are Madagascar Vanilla, Coffee and Indonesian Patchouli Leaf.💫Its a continuation of BO Le Parfums direction. That dry woody vanilla, mandarin echoes with a new cherry top. Instead of a solar jasmine, here we have a much more defined jasmine and a candied orange blossom as the center. Its quite good bouncing off the chocolate patchouli. Ths coffee note settles in the background.💫BOOR is still a synthetic miasma of notes but it handles the cherry and chocolate components well. I feel Le Parfum has been more head turning when I wear these, but BO Red does capture the cherry trend well for the YSL brand.💫Longevity is quite good with generous sprays. Sillage is about arms length, but it plays well and not a room disruptor.💫$160 90ml or 3.0oz bottle reviewed. Shrinkflation in the larger bottle size.💫You can layer TomFord Lost Cherry with BO LeParfum for better results of this idea"

The first spray blew me away with how delicious it was!Reminds me a little of scarlet poppy by Jo Malone.

For the price-point, i do wish performance of the cherry note was better... the cherry note is ""barely there"" and is faint, so i would buy the 30ml as a collector, but not splurge on the 90ml! if the cherry note was stronger, then this would be the perfect fragrance for me!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I had a small sample of this with an order, and I do not find it foul, by any means, but it's a bit too gourmand for my tastes. I do smell the black coffee, but mostly I get chocolate-covered cherries and vanilla, sooooo much vanilla. It has been a while since I smelled the regular Black Opium, but I think I liked it a bit more. Black Opium over Red has a cool name, but we're getting further away from the central metaphor (coffee as black opium, already a flawed metaphor because coffee, while addictive, jazzes you up, which is pretty much the exact opposite of what opium does). I mean, no one puts cherries in their coffee, right? I guess you could imagine yourself eating a slice of Black Forest cake while drinking black coffee generously infused with vanilla, but no one who is in the grip of opiate addiction is going to go for some bougie treat like that.I don't hate this, but I don't think it's full bottle worthy unless you work in a bakery making Black Forest cakes all day and want to smell exactly like your product, plus black coffee.Update: Longevity is not the greatest. As cherry-vanilla fragrances go, I prefer La Petite Robe Noire Black Perfecto, which performs better and has a more interesting note profile."

A very good scent, not very memorable but the quality is clearly high.Slighty spooky and sad. It makes me think of ""Der Leiermann"" from Schubert's Winterreise.I don't think anyone needs this if they already have Black Opium, but I would recommend it if you're a fan of darker cherry scents."

So I felt she was exaggerating on how bad Over Red could possibly be.This is a true example of smelling for yourself. I don’t care if every review you read says a scent is good, you might be that one person that it doesn’t jive with. In this case, I gotta wonder how many people are now totally uninterested in Over Red because of one obnoxiously bad review.Anyways, this is actually my favorite Black Opium in a long time! Possibly ever! It’s fruity and fun and the smell is addictive. The scent doesn’t really match the vibe of the bottle IMO. If it were translucent cherry red glass, it would go together better."

I don’t like the other black opium flankers at all. This perfume also has cherry and patchouli which are two notes that I usually despise. Cherry and patchouli are almost always overbearing. Weirdly enough those notes work well in this case, you can barely detect them. This perfume is mature, sexy, and complex. It’s the other flankers rich older sister. The longevity is great and it has decent projection. I’m glad I gave it a try."

For reference I really don't really like the Black Opium line, except this one.This Over Red flanker opens with a pleasant cherry that only last for few minutes (10-15mins). After that all I get is a very reminiscent impression of La Vie est Belle from Lancôme but more sophisticated and better blended. Overall on my skin it only lasted 3hours, which it clearly not enough for me and the projection and sillage are discrete."

My daughter has a sample of Over Red and I have to say, it's nice. It reminds me a lot of Hugo Deep Red. The coffee and cherry together make a very alluring, delicious combo that isn't too sweet- as I find cherry to be, in general. I think this is a beautiful nighttime take on white florals. Deeper, darker, but not necessarily serious or heavy. If you love cherry and the coffee-vanilla mix of Black Opium, this is worth trying."

However, I'm drawn to cherry notes, and I received this as a free sample, so I thought I would give it a go.It was nice, but it would be so much nicer if the cherry note didn't go away after ten minutes. It dried down and made me smell like what I can only describe as a mature woman.It's fine. Just not for me."

Oddly specific but it just smelt like any of the Black Opiums with a hint of play-doh to it and that note stuck around. It did stay on my skin for a solid amount of time and smelt alright, but I just couldn’t get that hint of play-doh out of my nose."

So pretty. Cherry dies down after the opening. While it lasts, it’s the kind of juicy sweet scent I’d want to keep dousing myself with. Maybe could prolong this effect by layering cherry fragrance to top up throughout the day.I could see how some people may get cough syrup with the mix of cherry and patchouli going medicinal when I smell up close: however, this doesn’t translate in the sillage.By the drydown, it's back to the classic Black Opium base."

With that hint of Cherry on the top, it becomes utterly seductive. The coffee and vanilla are elegantly put together. I'm really impressed. I tried to compare it with other strong fragrances and I can easily say it really stands out, with that Cherry it really is unique.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Yves-Saint-Laurent/Black-Opium-Over-Red-88707.html,Black Opium Over Red Yves Saint Laurent perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I just got my bottle and I’m wearing it for the first time for Christmas Eve!Here is my report:First impression: Smoother more wearable Black Opium with hints of cherry, vanilla is a main player here, second white florals and Cherry, but very soft and smooth all around. Cherry is not the most prominent note at first sniff here IMO, but more of a very present supporting role. So don’t imagine a strong sweet almondy Cherry perfume ala TF Lost Cherry. It’s definitely more of a sour cherry, not so juicy sweet as Lost Cherry (again, as reference), but still a pleasant Cherry indeed. I’ll say THIS IS BEAUTIFUL and if you like the Black Opium DNA or Nishane’s Hundred silent ways, you’ll love this one as I do. Also, I find it more wearable and less strong as the OG, so the plus is that you can wear in more circumstances. I’d say all seasons day or night, except summer heat.The more I wear it, Cherry is coming out a bit more, verging away from the original Black Opium DNA, but it’s still there. Lovely.Last edit: it wore well, not as long lasting on me as other reviewers mentioned. It got to be a skin scent on me in 4 hours. I still find the OG to be more long lasting in comparison. At the end of the 4/5 hour mark Cherry went away unfortunately. I still stand by that this is a smoother easier to wear Black Opium, but I actually wish the cherry note was stronger. I think I’ll layer with other cherry fragrances."

All I am smelling is burnt plastic with a little bit of sugar sprinkled on top.And do NOT come at me with the ""but you have to wait for it to maceraaaate"" stuff. I am not new to Arab fragrances, I own 10+ of them, and while, yes, some of them do become stronger with time, with some notes getting more prominent than others, it's not some magical process that completely changes the fragrance.I promise I'll delete this review if this magically changes into something else after ""maceration"" but for now, I am severely disappointed. :("

It's still really close to Dulce by Rosie Jane but I love that too so I'm totally okay with that.

No other perfume has met my sickeningly sweet ultra-gourmand fragrance desires like Eclaire has, and I don’t think I’ll find a scent I enjoy more for a long time. Any time I wear it, I get compliments from friends, servers, strangers- even when I am nose blind to the smell. People tell me it smells like pumpkin spice, almond cookies, brownies, and most have asked me where to get it.It is incredibly well worth the price, lasting almost 5 months with multiple re-applications per day. If I could buy this scent as a laundry detergent, lotion, shampoo/conditioner, I WOULD! I want everything I own to smell likeI can still catch whiffs of it on my clothes many hours after I spray it on, especially on a warmer day. I wouldn’t say it projects like crazy, but someone standing a few feet away could smell it.Finally, in comparison to Bianca Latte… I actually like Eclaire MORE.

I did buy Bianco Latte thinking that due to the price it will somehow beat Eclaire, but it just doesn't for me. Eclaire is superior, longevity wise at least.I honestly have no eyes for any of my fumes any more. Purchased the new Shalimar Millesime Jasmine, did not even open it nor i care to. Eclaire is the only perfume that is sitting on my night table, outside of our three perfume cabinets, i spray it after the shower in the morning and it will last till the next morning. Just inoffensive, sweet and beautiful, and finally, i have a signature! Never expected it to be Lattafa, or this cheap, but i don't care!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"No words can describe how enjoyable this scent is to me. Getting wiffs of this instantly puts me in a better mood. This makes me crave dessert. A rich vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce drizzled on top. Absolute compliment getter. I have not smelled bianco latte and i’m not planning to, but this as a fragrance is so good on its own. sugar note is similar to that in Nebras which is also a love of mine. I only wish this performed a little better. It lasts but it has weak projection and turns into a skin scent after 2 hours max, but if you accidentally spray this in your hair it can last for days. I’ve only had this for 2 weeks so i’m hoping the performance gets better in time, if you love nebras/ lactonic vanillas/ caramel bombs get this. Trust me"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Honestly… I can’t believe the hype this gets. I LOVE vanilla/caramel/super sweet gourmands, but this…. Girl I literally gagged. It smells so synthetic, so strong and so cheap to me. I tried washing it off and it wouldn’t budge from my skin. I actually hated this. I can’t trust the internet ever again"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It's like dipping a biscuit in hot milk and eating it. The caramel note is quite prominent and I think there is also almond in it. I also think that those who like Xerjoff Italica might like this. It is a very easy to wear fragrance, especially it has a kind of tone that suits the cold weather."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"brought this as i have a decant of bianco latte and can't bring myself to spend $$$ on the full bottle yet. my oh my it sure is similar. bianco latte is more rich and heavy for sure, while eclaire can slightly lean synthetic especially when first sprayed. but the dry down is where it's atttttt and performance i can't fault. it's a stunning dupe and i'm in love!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Sugar, vanilla, and those damn Lattafa white florals. It’s nice, five or more sprays will definitely get you a compliment, but it’s not groundbreakingly gourmand or worth $50 and the insane wait time. Someone else in here said it feels unfinished, and I think it’s the lack of true buttery or creaminess that it claims to have. Safe and a crowd pleaser, but not as cozy as I had hoped."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"sprayed on tee, still can smell it 8 hours later. Very sweet, little bit artificial, but I got fresh batch from 07/24, introduced air and will let it sit for a month. So far it's good"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I've finally decluttered it, it was simply too light with zero projection even with maceration and overspraying. My DUA bianco latte dupe is way stronger and actually worth it. This Lattafa performance is almost as bad as a body mist"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I own Bianco latte and decided to purchase Eclaire too because I don’t know how to keep my money in my wallet lol😂First of all I am OBSESSED with Bianco latte it is the most amazing lactonic vanilla caramel buttercream fragrance with a slight airy feel to it. Its a 10/10 vanilla gourmand scent and it is BEAST MODE and whenever I spray it I get compliments.I have caramel cascade too, which to me is not the same as bianco latte. It is alot more synthetic and has that balloon smell to it.Now for Eclaire: It is a spot on dupe of Bianco latte. I didn’t think any brand could get bianco latte right but lattafa nailed it. It smells the exact same for a fraction of the price. If you want to save money just get Eclaire. The exact same smell. Exact same vanilla caramel buttercream vibe🍦🍮 and it is also beast mode, it lasts a very long time. Bianco latte lasts a full day on me and I still smell it on clothes. Eclaire lasts about 10 hours on me.Ps. I personally love the bottle of Eclaire. Yes it is extra, but it’s so cute!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I adore this. I wanted to find a very gourmand perfume to compliment my EOS vanilla cashmere lotion, and this fits the bill for me. It's sugary sweet and delicious, but not in a nasty cloying way.I could really smell the musk in the opening, and it was strong enough I was a tad concerned as that wasn't what I had wanted. But it dries down to this silky sugary vanilla with the musk in the background keeping the scent quite sophisticated.It's a gentle scent that, layered with my lotion, lasts me throughout the day. I feel like you can wear this one pretty much anywhere. It's going to get noticed (it's that good), and I've found I get consistent positive comments. So far I've been told I smell like candy, a cookie, a smore and a muffin, or just overall something pleasant and sweet, all in a good way, lol.But it's not overpowering - it takes people a minute to realize it's me. It's sillage is moderate enough that unless you're within arms length or so you're not going to blast anyone's nostrils. Which, in my mind makes it perfect in the office, but also for an intimate setting. Truly wear anywhere.It's performed well so far in our cooler fall weather here (days ranging from 60's - low 80's) and I think it'll be good in the winter as well.For me the scent is a happy, sensual, feminine and alluring one. I've only had it a week, but I've worn it daily and am thinking it may become my go-to, as I don't see myself getting tired of it at all. It truly brings me joy to wear it, the scent is just uplifting. I've honestly never fallen in love with a scent quite so much. (And I have a pretty extensive collection).It also layers well with other scents I have that have similar/complimentary notes.Overall, I'd recommend this to anybody who loves sugary sweet, gourmand perfumes, and wants to, literally, smell like a snack."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This was not exactly what I was expecting. A little disappointed as it's not very strong and becomes a skin scent really quickly. Need to over spray to get something noticable out of it. I was hoping for more projection and and something that lasted longer and would be stronger. As it's not grounded and very fluffy it comes off to me as unfinished. Something is missing. Because of that it's perfect for layering. Guerlain Rosa Rossa Forte mixed with Eclaire is addictive. Eclaire layered with Burberry Her Elixir is magic.Even though this fragrance wasn't what I expected, it didn't do what I hoped it would do, it still has a place in my collection. Just wished it came at a lower price as I'll run through this quite fast with 8-10 sprays every time it's applied, and applied several times a day."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"So… big difference with Bianco Latte and Caramel Cascade. This one doesn’t last 🙄😂. And y’all hyped this thing so much that the prices now are insane. Don’t get me wrong very similar to Bianco Latte (but softer) and Caramel Cascade (my personal favorite, yes more than Bianco Latte believe it or not) so it does smell yummy but this is like the soft version of it. Which surprised me because that’s not the rule with middle eastern perfumes. So meh. Way overpriced I payed like 50 USD probably because the hype on tiktok, that’s how capitalism works but this does not cost that. At best it should cost 30 USD. So… not bad but overpriced AF."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Have not tested Bianco Latte so I cannot compare them. This one reminds me a lot of Van Cleef & Arpels Bois Dore, but like a watered down version. I own and adore the VC&A so for me this is a pass I don't need it. I would recommend it for teenage girls on a budget if they are not into celebrity scents."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Am I the only one getting a burned tire smell? lol
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,One word to describe it : DELICIOUS.This fragrance is for the true sweet gourmand lovers who want to smell edible. It’s a beautiful vanilla ice cream with caramel syrup smell. I was also told I smelled like a caramel/vanilla cupcake and I love it.It does have a sharp note at the beginning that smells like rubbing alcohol or maybe a bit like plastic but it disappears in a few seconds to a few minutes. It projects pretty well and the longevity is good as well.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I got a decant for this and I was very excited to smell a vanilla and caramel dream. However, I was a bit disappointed. It smelled like really really really strong coconut oil. Heavy and on the sticky side. I'm glad I didn't blind buy a full bottle. I let the decant sit for a week before writing this review and it's less heavy than when I first got it but it's still a bit much for me. I'll wear this once in a while when I feel like it but I probably have to rethink whether or not I really am a gourmand lover lol"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Not good . I love sweet fragrances such as yara but this is just gross. It smells like burnt synthetic plastic
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Well I can smell the lactonic and the caramel. And a note of like.... Balloniness? It's not unpleasant it's pretty neutral ! But disappointed, I usually love the lattafas but this one's okay"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I don't get the hype. It is sharp, synthetic, screechy, lasting power is no more than 15 minutes. I expected something creamy and sweet. This is not it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I hate to be the odd one out, but Éclaire didn’t live up to the hype for me. Based on the notes and reviews, I expected a sweet sugary vanilla dream, but what I got was strong dominating marzipan and almond essence notes with a fairly lactonic base, kinda similar to the ones in Shaghaf Oud Tonka and Tom Ford Lost Cherry. It just reminds me of the dry downs of actual gourmand perfumes, but only the last phase after all the best notes have faded.It is not offensive but it’s also not exciting or luxurious in any way. And if I’m being fair, yes, It’s pleasant, sur, but it’s more almond heavy than the sweet gourmand edible indulgent scent I was hoping for. You’ll definitely love it if you’re into almond forward fragrances though. So If Bianco Latte smells like this then I’ll pass. Not bad, just basic and quite redundant to be honest.Edit : There’s a definite gourmand element to Eclaire but it’s more like walking into a Sephora than a bakery. Think warm ambery powdery makeupey lipstickey sweetness. The almond essence/marzipan doesn’t make it gourmand to me, it rather makes it bitter and a bit boozy. Definitely doesn’t remind me of cookies, cakes or any sort of baked goods."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It’s so thick, sweet, and creamy, like I dropped a chocolate croissant dipped in vanilla milk on my shirt. But after trying to convince myself that I like it for 2 months, I’ve decided that I don’t want to smell like that 🫤 It does get me a lot of compliments for sure but I don’t think this is my vibe. Same issue with Bianco Latte."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Yum, the smooth caramel is just so delicious. For a super-sweet scent it’s actually quite calm as it’s oh-so smooth. It’s like a praline paste. I actually detest Bianco Latte as it's so tooth-achingly sweet and makes me feel sick, but this..! Eclaire is more along the lines of Tihota Indult and Escapade Gourmande minus the almond/marzipan note. This is what I imagine Beyonce’s natural skin to smell like. I never expected to like this but it’s love. 9 hours after I first sprayed and my boyfriend gets into the car with me to declare “it smells like caramel in here”. Fantastic longevity into the next day too. Affordable signature worthy perfection."

I literally just opened the package. It smells so familiar. Like something from my HS years. VS Amber Romance? BBW Warm Vanilla Brown Sugar? Something vanilla-ish circa '97? But more mature?When I first sprayed, I was like WTF? As it's drying it's getting prettier and prettier. It smells like dulce de leche (caramelized sweetened condensed milk), honey, and vanilla, w a tuberose undertone. As sweet as it is, there is a powdery quality that keeps it from being cloying. I can tell it's gonna be gorgeous w maceration. I've been searching for an EDP of Sol Janeiro '71. This is definitely it. But more mature. I'm in love 🥰"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Condensed milk & vanilla-infused marshmallow lightly toasted, then covered with a caramel & praline sauce that hardens to form a nice shell. Delicious and super gourmand, but it doesn't get foody, just retains its sweetness.Projects intensely off my skin and lasts for hours, goes for days on clothes.Definitely kin to Bianco Latte, I'd say first cousins.Cool/cold weather only, too intense for the hot summer months."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a good good scent. I would even say very unique. The gourmand aspect is crazy. It is very very edible and super sweet but in a soft, feminine and very creamy way? I get that people could find it weird (plastic like?) At first because it really smells different from other edible scents out there. I'm actually obsessed and want to keep smelling it all day."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"looking at the reviews, I'll most likely come back to write another review, after it macerates a bit. I got it only yesterday, and I can't get past this plasticky smell that reminds me of a plastic toy from my childhood. Might be the praline note? as of now I can't say it's an immediate ""Love"" for me, maybe it's because this was a blind buy and I had imagined something slightly different. We'll see"

My most complimented perfume ever, strangers come up to me and ask me what I’m wearing. It’s a good strong perfume that you can smell when you walk into a room. The longevity could be better but I don’t mind respraying for the price. Makes you smell edible love the vanilla caramel notes.

I LOVE Gourmands & have repurchased Choco Musk for many years. I am not expecting the same, but I am down w/ the chocolate! I will review here in about a week. I went ahead & posted b/c I NEEDED to say **@Bronstet** How RUDE! You cannot put an AGE on what a person wants to smell like!! You said twice ""This is not for an older person"" So when YOU get old & you still like this, are you going to throw it away? Your review had me leaning toward you being intelligent & you blew it! Don't ever...EVER.. tell a guy, girl, older man, older woman what they can & cannot wear. Simple minded.Update~ Unfortunately this wasn't my girl. I got the weird smell with the sweetness overkill. & Could NOT get it off of me. I tried teensy bit twice,. I mean tiny, it wont work. I also didn't get chocolate at all others are getting. It could be b/c I have a lot of very chocolatey perfumes. One of the reasons I love Choco Musk so much is bc it doesn't have that weird twist to it. It is like an Arabic DNA,, which I have MANY of, don't get me wrong. It just comes off as medicinal in sweet fragrances. I am so glad this works for so many people. It is a beast & trust me, probably would last on a shirt for a year, haha. I still stick to what I said, you wear this whether man, woman, young or 106 years old.

It's one of the best gourmand perfumes that I have ever smelled. Super sticky sweet, milky, caramel amazing-ness. The lasting power is incredible, over 8+ hours for me. The only thing I don't like is the giant clunky bottle but I don't really care that much, the smell makes up for the ugly bottle. I just wish I would have bought this sooner!!! YUM.😍"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is now my second review of this lol.I reviewed this back when I first got it but I think this truly needs time to macerate. I got it back in late May but there was a cheap wax from a dollar store candle note I couldn't get past. I just had it sitting on my perfume tray unused during these hot months, didn't even reach to smell it bc the notes are cozy and delicious but nauseatingly sweet in the summer. Now that summer has come and is basically nearly gone and 3 months have passed that cheap wax note has subsided a lot. Still there but subsided. Also the scent is now less thick/heavy/chokingly creamy and more like a crystalized golden sugar vanilla. Pre maceration it had a prominent coconut note to my nose that is softer too now. If you buy this and dont like it at first let it macerate and try again before you give it up!! Lasting power is insanely good. The ONE spray on the back of my hand lasted through multiple dishwashing and hand washing sessions. Can still smell it! One thing I really don't like is the price gouging of this perfume. The whole point of this brand is that it's supposed to be affordable. I think even spending more than 50 bucks for this is overpaying. It's good but not THAT good."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"When I’m wrong, I’m wrong. This is GORGEOUS. What a beautiful perfume.If you don’t initially like this, please, spray it about 10 times and let this sit for a month or so!The first time I tried this, it was plasticky/synthetic/ VERY white floral heavy veering towards dated. It smelled like a weird heavily-scented candle with a dash of sunscreen.Now, after a month, this has transformed. The white florals are non-existent, the candle-esque sunscreen smell is gone, and now it smells like the most delicious milky vanilla, honey, cherry-almond. It’s warm and syrupy. It reminds me of a dessert my husband’s Italian grandpa made. Not a baked good, but like a silky heavy cream with LOADS of sugar. SUPER gourmand. But a sexy, grown-up gourmand. I couldn’t see this on a teen. Confidently 20+.Tooth-achingly realistic and sweet, as all the florals are completely gone, but I’m not mad. I love Choco Musk by Al-Rehab, so I love me a photo-realistic gourmand.The honeypot character in a perfume!I can’t stop sniffing my arm now. I feel gaslit. This is the same perfume I originally hated?TikTok shop is where I got mine. Usually MUCH cheaper, and mine was a sealed authentic box.Totally happy to say I was wrong about hating this one!Edit: Settled on the skin more, it’s an almond-scented vanilla marshmallow.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"So, I'm in love with this.It's not a love at first spray though, it smelled very alcoholic and basically it smelt like nothing to be honest.But we've learnt our lesson by now, Arab fragrances needs maceration.I've sprayed like 15 sprays and then kept it in a dark cupboard without its cap for a few days, like I always do now and I unleashed its magic.In the first few minutes this smells like a caramel flan or Creme Caramel like they sometimes call it, imagine If you're eating this dessert and some of it comes on your finger, you realise that your finger is sticky and you smell it and it smells like this dessert, these are the first few minutes of Eclaire ladies and gentlemen.On the dry down, this smells like the cup of milk with a spoon of honey that you drink at night to help you fall asleep and make you feel warm.Comparing this to Caramel Cascade , it is definitely better, softer and more blended than CC, and it doesn't have this sharp and powdery licorice note that CC has.This can be compared to Cheriosa 71 too but still, it's more blended, softer and not as heavy and more natural, in a good way."

Wish I could have loved it as well :("

Smells amazing but lasts for like an hour, if that. Like someone else said it has the projection and longevity of a body spay. I ended up purchasing dapper's version instead and absolutely loved it! It lasts forever on me, and I made everyone's neck snap when I walked by. Its also more vanilla musk base and softer which I like. Eclaire is a little more synthetic.

This is it.Today I am comparing both Eclaire and Bianco Latte. After one hour I can´t say which is which. What is incredible, they have a really good longevity and sillage on my skin, which is rather unusual for me.I love them both but I love Eclaire more for its price. I had to get another bottle just in case they stop making it!!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,TL;DR: It has the same delightful scent as the creamy center of a Rafaello.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Update: I’m soooo mad. Ha I don’t get “BEAST MODE”I think my curiosity with Arabic dupes is OVER!!Waste of money!! For a bit more? I could have had the dang real thing!! It does smell very close to BL. But it’s a flipping body spray what a joke! Do better lattafa I’m not spending $55 on a body mist in a tacky bottle! No one likes the damn bottles anyway!!!!9/29/24Well I think I’ll get the original….this is way too light on me!?? Idk if that’s me? Or if other people have the same issue? Feels like body spray to me :( BUT it smells great! Just too light

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I purchased this after I grabbed Oakcha's That Girl/Viral Vanilla, both which are Bianco Latte dupes, although I have not tested Bianco Latte yet.The first spray is IDENTICAL to That Girl. In your face sweet caramel vanilla. It also has similarities to VS Vanilla Lace (discontinued) with a hint of BBW Warm Vanilla Sugar and Marshmallow Fireside (I am not huge a fan of these). The loudness of the first spray dries down and it becomes very cozy and wearable. The dry down is actually gorgeous.I find that this scent is more beautiful on my skin than Oakcha's That Girl. There is a nostalgic undertone that reminds me of a babydoll/toy from the 90s... A sweet/soft milky marshmallow, with a hint of powder-or perhaps its the white florals I am detecting. I think when people say they smell rubber/plastic, this is the note that they are referring to, but to me it is lovely (not burnt or plastic smelling at all).Between the two fragrances mentioned I would choose Eclaire. It is very similar to That Girl and I do not think you need both, but this one to me is more lactonic, and the honey/white florals make it slightly elevated. If you do not like the sound of my previous paragraph ^ then I would go for the Oakcha version.All in all, I find this fragrance to be sweet and comforting, delicious, and truly cozy. It is incredibly long lasting on both my skin and clothing, and the price cannot be beat. People will tell you that you smell like cookies and rice krispie treats as you walk by and you will be satisfied smelling like a treat. ;)"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I'm kinda disappointed! I expected more.EDIT: Okay I was wrong lol! I can still smell it on me 5hs later and it is pretty delicious. It is nothing too complex you can even say it's juvenile but nonetheless super yummy and gourmand.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The first sprays of this are awful, they give off a rubbery smell and nothing else. Then, a couple sprays later you get a rubbery smell with a sweet caramel background which is quite synthetic. To me I couldn't get past the rubber smell because it lasts a good 3 hours and then when that smell goes away you're left with a sweet caramel vanilla scent. I don't find this to be a groundbreaking fragrance unfortunately, it's a synthetic type of sweet and the rubbery smell gives me a headache and makes me nauseous. I find that there are better done gourmands by lattafa like nebras and yara. I know these fragrances need to sit and macerate but I usually need to like the fragrance first and then put it in maceration (this was the case with yara and nebras) and then I will love it even more but I don't find it worth it to buy fragrances that you don't like just to let them macerate and see if you'll enjoy them then... Other than the rubbery note, it is definitely a gourmand, it smells like a pastry shop, it is very sweet and linear. I don't think this is a bad fragrance, I just find it too synthetic and it's more caramel than vanilla and I'm more of a vanilla girly."

Sweet warm vanilla, soft buttery caramel, honeyed milk, it’s delicious, this is THE gourmand. Brilliant dupe of bianco latte, but with a much nicer price tag. It’s just so good.It is toothachingly sweet, so if you’re not into that then this will not be for you. But this has become an instant favourite for me."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"After mixed results with various Lattafa fragrances - some good, some not so good - this one I had high hopes for. Sadly, it's bad. Quite bad actually. Not sure if it needs macerating (I ordered it right after the website restocked, so maybe it's from a ""fresh"" batch) - if it improves I will edit this review.First spray is strong alcohol and not much else. Eventually once I pick up notes it smells very synthetic- like very sweet, cheap, mass produced high fructose corn syrup vanilla baked goods. Not great. Minimal projection - 8 sprays on each arm and 5 on the front of my tshirt and barely smelled anything after the strong alcohol smell started to dissipate. Yuck.I'm really hoping this one improves after a month or so in my closet!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,A sweet almond! The almond smell pulls strongly for me when I smell it up close on my skin. As I move I get small whiffs of a more medicinal almond smell mixed with like a Choco Musk sweetness. I’m interested to see how much I like it in the future as I wear it more. But it’s pleasant! I’m not immediately in love with it. A bit disappointed bc I expected an intoxicating sickly sweet gourmand but it just smells like almonds to me haha. It’s very light on me I could wear this regularly any season.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"yuummy, creamy, sweet, lactonic vanilla and caramel perfume. my boyfriend said i smelled like caramel, he really liked it. i love it so much, HOWEVER, I oversprayed and became nose blind to it. but my parents were able to smell me and said i smelled like a bakery lol. i have decided to order bianco latte (aka the fragrance it is duping). i cannot wait!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"A really pleasant creamy vanilla gourmand that I can see working year around. That being said, I typically like my vanilla to have bit more depth or spice or something. I almost feel Eclaire is missing something. Don't get me wrong, it's nice scent especially for day time wear. It's just not groundbreaking and I don't think I will be buying a full size bottle (especially since the bottle is, well, quite tacky)."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It’s another one I tried and not sure what it is, I cannot have this on my skin.It’s another one that immediately cause me a headache and after 1 hrs I had to try and scrub off my wrist.So - on initial spray it seems like nothing happens, like there’s barely any scent. Don’t be fooled and tempted to spray more, wait. After a few minutes it appears, as if the skin temperature warms it up,It’s sweet, very vanilla but with underlying medicinal note, it almost does not belong there?The scent keeps growing and so is my headache…Objectively - it’s nice, if I physically could, I would wear it.Like i said, i tried to scrub off but it remains! It’s becoming creamier and a bit lactonic.Definitely one for colder months and do not overspray this.If you can wear it, I think it’s a good buy for the price.If you prone to scent induced headaches- better try it, i am normally a pro at designer/celeb blind buys without issue but it’s another lataffa, that has caused a physical reaction. Sadly, no from me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I purchased eclair as a dupe for Bianco latte . After having received a sample of the real thing I honestly think this is a great dupe . I wore eclair for a full work day and still smelled it on myself 8+ hours later . Not only that a coworker complimented how good and “expensive” I smelled . As a fragrance lover that a gold star in my book . This scent if for all my gourmand lovers . It smells like a creamy vanilla ice cream dripping in caramel and whip cream . To my nose it reminds me of walking into cold stone creamy . I love this and will be getting a back up .
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Even though there’s no coconut note listed, to me this smells like desiccated coconut or some thai dessert with a lactonic background.

I have to really get close my nose to my clothes if I want to smell it. Also, same Lattafa dna. I kinda like it, but i don't know. After having Yara or Khamrah, this seems a bit redundant (and those two have wayyy better performance). Let's see if in a few weeks/months if it improves and I get the hype too."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This one really needs to macerate. The alcohol on opening stays for at least 5-10 mins. Extremely overpowering. On dry down it does have a sweet caramel creamy smell but is very synthetic. Reminds me a little of prada candy.Smells beautiful after about an hour of wear. I sprayed this 4 hours ago and can still smell on my skin so far. This sounds like a negative review 🤣 it absolutely isn’t you just need to work with the perfume and wait for the alcohol to die down then it’s lovely!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Only thing I have to sah about this scent is that it is VERY long lasting. I slrayed this on me yesterday at 8 pm. I woke up today at around 11 am and still smell it on my wrist and I get whiffs of it still.When you first spray it it's like caramel, but the more it sits it becomes less caramely and more vanilla.Very sweet and gourmand, very cozy and also airy and attractive.I'd say this is a dafe blind buy if you love sweet sents."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Some background on my likes and dislikes:- notes I love: musk, vanilla, ambroxan, caramel, macadmia, jasmine, neroli, tuberose, bergamot, fig- notes I usually don't usually like: leather, patchouli, tobacco, cinnamon, anything fruity, pepper, oud- some of my favorite perfumes: Dior L'Or, GDT Bianco Latte, Amouage Love Tuberose, JHAG Not a Perfume, Narciso For Her EDT, Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess, Prada Paradoxe Intense, Cheirosa 71If your taste is anything like mine, you will love this. Many people are saying this is the most gourmand perfume ever, but I personally don't find it so gourmand. When I first spray it, I pick up mostly on a beautiful musky white flower smell with a hint of vanilla. The longer it stays on my skin the stronger the vanilla becomes. The praline becomes noticeable after the perfume sits on the skin for some time. But again, in my opinion, this is too musky and flowery to be as gourmand as people make it out to be. It is so so beautiful though. This has quickly become one of my all time favourite perfumes. On me, it lasts 4-5 hours. But not a single perfume lasts longer than that on my skin so I consider that decent.Compared to Bianco Latte, Eclaire is much more vanilla-y and rich and it's my preferred one between the two."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I’ve had this for 3 weeks now. Initial sprays were sweet and caramel. After the first dry drown it honestly smelled like chocolate Rice Krispies with milk. On my skin I would get milky, caramel, and sometimes a whiff of cherry? It lasts I would say 5-7 hours at most. By the end of the day I also get like a very faint flower dipped in sugar? I got two compliments the first day I wore it. Someone said I smelled delicious like cookies. Now that I’ve been using it more it has blended to a more creamier scent. Someone else recently said I smelled like candy and like the Bianca Latte perfume. I’ve never smelt it but the person said it smelled exactly alike. The scent can be cloying if you use too much. So I suggest spray some on forearms three-four times both sides and slightly on clothes, avoid the neck. Overall I’m very happy, it was a blind buy and now it has turned into my everyday scent until I find another marshmallow or clean scent."

I havent tried Bianco latte but this smells really good and sweet, but make sure to macerate it. Doesnt last long tho :/"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I really like this one a lot. It's sweet, creamy and reminds me of cookies from the Italian bakery. Such an easy reach if you just want to smell edible and good. It's long lasting as well. It's the type of scent that has you sniffing your arm constantly. I've never smelled Bianco Latte so I can't compare. Someone in the comments asked if this is similar to Nebras. To my nose no. Nebras is more chocolaty with the berries, Eclaire is more sugar, cookies, fluffy, milky dessert kind of smell. Both are great in their own way and different enough to own both."

On me i mostly smell the caramel and then once it dries down the vanilla. I sprayed it on me today at 7.30am before i left for work. I saw a friend at 4.30pm and i just opened her can door, hadnt even gotten in the car and she told me i smelled like a cupcake! My other friend who was also in the car said i smelled like vanilla! So apparently it does last a good 8 hours plus without re-application! I was very impressed to say the least!"

It's like a gooey caramel, with whipped vanilla cake batter and milk. There's a real fluffy / fuzzy aspect to this fragrance that makes it SO cozy and enjoyable. I will say though, it also smells a tiiiny bit like a candle but it's not too noticeable, this aspect also disappears entirely when sprayed only on clothes / in the air.On clothes / scent bubble in the air: It smells like vanilla cupcakes, or cookies. Just a sweet, non-descript baked good with a pinch of musk and florals. It's delicious and I find it's different to the way it is on skin, so if you're not feeling it on your skin I IMPLORE you - spray it on your duvet once or twice and then leave the room, when you come back in it'll smell like a bakery. All of the notes on the pyramid come through as well.I've fallen in love with this!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Ok, so this perfume is a problem to me.Let me explain:Immediately upon spraying, I smell nice yummy lactonic caramel and vanilla, mixed with the most off-putting (parsley and tomato) smell, the tomato smell is exactly like: a carton filled with unwashed tomatoes, which was left under the heat of the sun for a long time.It’s a shame, as I love the lactionic vanilla notes, but the parsley and 🍅 comes to hit my nose immediately like a truck.I bought the perfume right when it was released, and it had its time to macerate, I tried it many times, but still the same issue.I still will try it from time to time, as I am in denial, I keep waiting for the “beautifulness” that everyone in social media is talking about🥲One last thing: this perfume has an insane longevity and spillage, lasts for +12 on my clothes.I’ll keep praying 🙏 god I love tomatoes but in salads, I don’t want to smell like a meal and a dessert at the same time."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This perfume had me completely on the first sniff itself, have become my favourite since then. You are gonna smell like a delicious toffee or caramel glazed cookie. Such a warm and cozy perfume that will definitely lift your mood. The caramel note is so gorgeous and smooth it will get stronger as it macerates. The main stars are Caramel, Vanilla, Milk and Praline. The honey can be noticed a bit but the florals are almost non existent. This is a complement magnet and is 98% same as Bianco Latte which i have a decant of. The scent profile is same and the projection and longitivtiy is almost 8-9 hours on me, where as Bianco Latte lasts 10+ hours. I wear it just as it is or I pair it with ""By The Fireplace"" so it becomes a bit unisex (but still a gorgeous gourmand) as it is too feminine for certain occasions."

It’s very very sweet but much cozier and fluffier than other sweet scents I’ve tried. And it’s POWERFUL. I made the mistake (or blessing in disguise tbh) of spraying my sample on my skin and clothes before bed one night to try it out, now my sheets and pillows smell of it. And it’s lovely, it’s like sleeping on the coziest cloud. Right now I am laying in bed, and I have another perfume on, but all I can smell is Eclaire on my pillow, it’s crazy.I will indeed buy a full bottle once I go through my sample, I’m sorry for judging you too quickly Lattafa. I didn’t get it at first but I do now.If anything it goes to show, if your first impression is disappointing keep trying it and you might love how it develops over time."

This was the compliment I got with a smile from the female store manager at the LCBO liquor store I was purchasing very expensive wine from. That's all you need to know about this fragrance. My young fragrance loving nephew told me that I should have answered ""Would like to take a bite?"" Love how he thinks but as she selling me a very expensive and exclusive wine, I thought it best not to piss her off. :PSo now ask yourself, would you like to smell just like a chocolate cookie? Do you love gourmand fragrances so much that you actually want to literally smell like food? Do you love fragrances so sweet that you're tempted to actually take a sip of them instead of just spraying them on? Are you the type of person that unlike me would actually go, screw it, damn the wine, and reply ""Would you like to take a bite?"" If so, this is absolutely your fragrance. The only other one I've ever tried as close as this is Nebras which is also from Lattafa and is an even chocolatier version of this. I own both and just the mere thought of layering these two together is giving me a sugar rush that could make my head explode.If the answer to my questions above is ""No,"" however, then you should stay very very far away from this fragrance. It's an incredibly sweet blend of vanilla, honey, caramel and powder aromas. The notes are surprisingly simple but my God is this thing powerful. It's a superb performer. It's perfect for date nights and intimate occasions. It works well in warm weather which is a pleasant surprise. The only possible quibble is that it lacks a fresh note to liven it up -- same as with Nebras -- but if that's what you want then you should be enjoying the sweet and fresh Invictus/Hawas/Phantom/One Million style of fragrance instead of this one.You know what you're getting with this one. Older users should avoid it and you definitely don't want to use it for serious occasions, especially somber ones. Other than that, have fun with this one. Highly recommended, especially for gourmand fragrance lovers. Check out Nebras as well while you're at it."

I get nothing but a burnt plastic smell. Even on the dry down I smell that burnt odor that is happening. I know my bottle is a newer batch and I am not sure if that is part of the issue, but when you buy something you shouldn't have to let it sit for months before use. I can understand things getting better with time, but to be awful straight away is pretty disappointing."

While I do smell the lactonic caramel, sickly sweet aspect to it, I'm also getting a strange burnt note that I just cannot deal with. I also purchased Khamrah and Affection from Lattafa, and those two are absolute perfection to me, so I guess it's just Eclair with this problem. I really wish I didn't get that burnt rubbery smell with this one as I can tell that it would have been so so so good without. Longevity was meh, I thought it would have lasted much longer, but it's not half bad for the price point.Another issue I have with this one is that whenever I spray it, it tickles my nose and makes me want to sneeze - but just for a couple seconds and then the feeling subsides. I'm not sure what's triggering this reaction from me, as I have never had that happen before, and I work at a fragrance retailer so I am constantly surrounded by different scents. Just all around a bit of a disappointment with this one.Will definitely let sit to macerate for some time to hopefully alleviate some of the issues I'm having before I give my final impression on this one. I'm hoping it will get better before the colder months!"

Like I genuinely feel like I’m taking a bubble bath and using my mom’s shower gel for bubbles or applying my Warm Vanilla Sugar lip balm. Just received it today but so far? Obsessed.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I prefer this to Bianco Latte. With Bianco Latte the coumarin has a barnyard/farm animal urine smell that never fully goes away.Eclair smells a lot like Bianco without the hay leaning coumarin and with a slightly more rounded spice note. It smells like roasted tonka to me but it maybe the praline note.This lasts long enough for the price point. The projection is a little more noticeable to me than Bianco but I just might have weird chemistry.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Testing out a sample, and it's weirdly kind of medicinal on me? I don't get that on paper at all but on skin it's got an intensely chemically, synthetic, sort of plasticky opening that I haven't seen many people mention. I'll let macerate and try again in a month or two, but it smells like eating a super sweet vanilla cupcake or a milkshake but in like a hospital waiting room. It's so strange, and a little headache inducing for me personally.The dry-down is a very pretty long lasting vanilla, but nothing too special. I wouldn't even say for the price it's good because the opening is so strange I don't know if it's worth it.Have never smelled Bianco Latte so I cannot speak on it as a dupe but so far not very impressed.Edit: The dry down really is SO nice though, it's so soft and sweet, milky and comforting. I even think it would make a nice cozy bedtime scent if you're into sweet perfumes. Hopefully after some time the opening isn't as intense, I want to enjoy it because the dry down is lovely."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,What the hell?! I smell vanilla cupcakes and bug spray or like a tire fire or something. I'm going to set this to the side for awhile and revisit in a month. Hopefully it will macerate into whatever everyone else is smelling. Will update results.Update: Ok the bug spray smell totally disappeared and this smells amazing! I was so wrong. This is exactly the gourmand I've been looking for. Beautiful creamy vanilla and milky caramel with a hint of honeyed cake. Just splendid! I can't wait to see what it smells like in a month...if there's any left!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I'm gonna have to say Lattafa knocked it out of the park with this one. I've never smelled Bianco Latte, and I know people say this a dupe, but something that is also often talked about with Bianco is the superb longevity, and Eclaire's longevity is amazing. Half the price or less, and this lasts all day. It's difficult for me to find gourmands that last, or really any fragrance that truly lasts these days, but this is a beast. The scent is a thick caramel, lactonic sweetness, with very subtle hints of a floral powdery musk. Lovely, delicious. If gourmands are your thing, this is the best bang for your buck I've purchased in a good while."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Lattafa frags are quite bizarre eh? You have to bear with them for a while before they show their true colors, not in a negative way most of the time. This one here was initially a hushed up lactonic caramel peppered with floral nuances with not much of a throw and a certain degree of syntheticity but then after maturation the projection is better and the scent is up to par. Still a tad synthetic as others have mentioned but that doesn't get in the way much. I spray it before going to bed only and it does the job which is taking me back to the calmness and sweetness of my childhood. It's not supposed to blow your socks off but to sweeten the deal (life) a bit. The bottle couldn't be tackier though."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"As someone who loves gourmands, vanilla and sweet fragrances in general, I bought this because I was intrigued by the idea of a laconic scent and heard enough times that this smells identical to Bianco Latte but with a more reasonable price. You can definitely smell the honey, sugar, milk and vanilla the most, but I have always been wary of Lattafa as a fragrance house all together however because to my nose, they always seem to manage to squeeze in some spiciness or oudiness into all the perfumes I've smelt even when in doesn't make sense when looking at the notes... and unfortunately I once again smell it slightly in this perfume. It makes the fragrance very dense, thick and heavy- definitely not suitable for the summer time imo. Although I really like it, I think I will enjoy it even more during the fall and winter time, but for mid august in Texas it's way too overbearing right now."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Very disappointed. Smells like straight vanilla extract but barely there at all. Wanted something rich luxurious and super creamy vanilla. So happy I sampled before to test. Wouldn’t recommend if you’re wanting a super sweet vanilla. I’d say if you like milky smelling perfumes you’d probably give this one a go

I appreciate a good gourmand, and this one isn’t cloying, so I love wearing it in the Texas heat, and I plan on wearing it year round.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I tried a sample of this vs Bianco Latte and they are VERY similar. Bianco Latte has a strong almond opening on me, that I don't particularly like, but settles down to a beautiful creamy caramel scent that I do love in cooler weather. Eclaire doesn't have that same opening and gets straight to the sweet creamy scent, it might not last as long as BL and may smell a fraction more artificial, but they both last all day and smell lovely and sweet and the differences in the scents are almost undetectable when it dries down.I want to add that this review is based off decants. I have heard that Eclaire in a new bottle needs to ""macerate"" for a few weeks or months to smell similar to BL. If you are having issues getting Eclaire to smell like BL, maybe try setting it aside in a dark cupboard and spraying it once a week for a month or two. It will help the scent mix with oxygen and develop the sweet vanilla & caramel notes.This is a full bottle purchase for me (just waiting for it to be restocked) and it saves me a bit of money, win win!"

It’s cozy with a sugary lactonic caramel, like a solid caramel, not gooey and dries down into a powdery musk that sits pleasantly on the skin.I sadly do get the synthetic smell but it isn’t harsh enough to overpower."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I have been wearing this for a week. It smells exactly Bianco Latte. The only difference is you get the praline scent with Eclaire. This is a very sweet perfume. If your not into gourmands you will hate it. It smells like caramel and coconuts. It last all day. I even get a skin scent the next day. Sooo Good

It is VERY sweet, delicious, and gourmand.Two to three spritzes of this, and you’re well-covered, so those around you can smell your perfume.On me, the fragrance lasts 18-24 hours.I definitely detect vanilla, but also notes of honey, milk, and caramel.The scent softens after a few hours but remains consistent.A truly wonderful fragrance.I can definitely recommend it.As others have mentioned, a slight orange residue appears on the atomizer after it has been sitting unused in the cabinet.You can easily wipe it off.I don’t know what it is or why it happens. I've never experienced this with any other perfumes before.But honestly... it doesn’t bother me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Comparing both Eclaire and Bianco Latte, I can smell the differences the longer both sits on my skin. In terms of similarities, both smell like sweet cereal with the sweetened milk left behind, rice krispies, etc. Both also have an almond, almost cherry-like feel to it. I'm assuming that's from the honey and caramel mixing in.Eclaire has background florals that linger throughout the whole composition. It doesn't have the powdery note that Bianco Latte has with its coumarin. It also teeters into a cherry/licorice vibe. Personally, Eclaire smells dated with its florals and gourmand notes mixed together. It also smells synthetic, less blended, and sickly sweet. I am sensitive to certain scents so I am easily nauseated by fragrances like this.Bianco Latte smells more ""organic"" and smooth. The coumarin really makes it smell like powdered marshmallows (think Lucky Charms). It has a chocolate or powdered cocoa feel to it. There's no florals in here (which I prefer). Bianco Latte smells full bodied whereas Eclaire smells ""hollow"" and thin.Overall, I choose Bianco Latte over Eclaire as it's truly a well-rounded, full gourmand, that's surprisingly not heavy or sickly sweet. Performance for both fragrances are crazy. I'd stick to two spritzes on yourself. Honestly, Eclaire is probably the closest dupe you'll ever find to Bianco Latte. If you're short on money or don't want to spend that much, Eclaire is a solid choice unless you are sensitive to scents or enjoy the nuances of the original."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My second review - because I can admit when I'm wrong. At first wear I thought it was childish and it gave out a scented candle vibe. That was on 7/30. A week later, and I literally wore nothing else since that day. I am obsessed with it. My entire collection became obsolete, 708 bottles of perfumes that I could care less about, all because of Eclaire...It's Elixir Charnel Gourmand Coquin on steroids. My favorite perfume, which I hardly ever wear because in my mind I will live to be 180 years old, and I don't want to die without it. But Eclaire is all that and more, because where Gourmand Coquin goes softer over time, Eclaire doesn't, and it stays linear throughout the entire wear, so all you smell is delicious chocolate the whole day long. And as it's always true for sweet perfumes, my husband keeps complimenting me and saying how good I smell, because men prefer sweet, gourmand perfumes on women, it's a scientific fact.I use two sprays of Eclaire under my shirt in the morning and it lasts me over 24 hours, and often after a shower too. Now I understand why this little crap is sold out everywhere at all times. Been looking for that ""One Perfume"" and what do you know, it's Eclaire. I think I would like to try Bianco Latte now as well and compare the two."

Too sweet.⁂It doesn't give me a headache, or anything, it's just too. much.I can see it working well for other people.If it means anything, I wasn't too enamored with Bianco Latte, either.This one's at least more affordable.I applied it at 2 PM, now it's almost 11 PM and I can still smell it.Projection is, at least with the test amount (always 1 or 2 sprays on my upper arm), intimate."

I love to wear it after my night shower while lathered in body cream, in my freshly cleaned pj’s and then sit on the couch for my relaxing time before bed. It’s an easy reach, it smelled great right off the bat which is rare for Lattafa perfumes in my experience ( I usually have to let them sit).

On first spray there is a LOT of alcohol, but give it a minute and you'll get the sweet delicious gourmand, chocolate and honey is what I pick up first, then the creamy sugaryness lingers for about 6 or so hours.

I was interested in Bianco Latte but since I live in a remote area I was a bit concerned about blind buying. I figured the price point for this made it a safe BB to sample this type of note.I bought Eclaire along with 2 other Lattafa scents (Khair Pistachio and Khamrah) to test out the brand. The Eclaire perfume box felt much cheaper and basic than the other two bottles I received. The Eclaire bottle was just sort of free floating in the flimsy cardboard box it ships in, whereas Khamrah has a wooden case with a velvet cut out that the bottle sits in. The Eclaire lid was off the bottle in the box and I noticed the atomizer was sticky and had residue around it, I could see that the bottle was leaking slightly. I also noticed that there was some slight visual defects with the bottle, where the writing is on the bottle there are some random globs of the gold material where it shouldn't be.I sprayed the perfume a bit and got a sense for the smell, cleaned the atomizer and then put the bottle away for a bit to let it macerate. I pulled the bottle out a few weeks later, noticed the cap was covered in reside again and could see small amount of liquid that had pooled under the atomizer.@pppployyyy23 I have had the same experience. I see orange residue cleaning out the atomizer, around the pump and the cap. I noticed a sharp and unpleasant smell after I cleaned out the atomizer, it had developed a slight clog that mixed with the normal sweetness of the perfume has turned me off of this scent a bit. I noticed a few days after that cleaning that the atomizer is once again covered in a film. I store my perfume in my closet, out of light and I live in a place where there is little to no humidity here so it's not a environmental issue in my house. I'm concerned about using this product now.I did notice with the perfume that is does have crazy performance. I can clearly smell the scent on clothing the following day. The scent is sweet and get that milky note, I found the caramel doesn't come through very strong for me I get a sweet milky scent and can't really break down the notes further than that. I think this could be a nice layering scent. I'm also torn with the various issues I have with this perfume in the short amount of time that I have owned it and as such probably wouldn't recommend it.I obviously got a lemon and it's soured me on the brand and product."

With this blend, I get a condensed, sweetened coconut milk scent on my skin, though it isn’t described in the profile. And when it comes to coconut, it’s not the sexy coconut-on-the-beach vibe. As a Thai, I’m familiar with this scent profile from traditional desserts. I don’t find it groundbreaking or appealing. You need just one spray to last 8+ hours, but it can be quite nauseating in a tropical climate. It’s better when layered with a more ambery, sophisticated perfume, but I personally would not recommend this for hot weather. I’m not even sure I can finish my 2ml sample."

Also somewhat similar to Caramel Dream, but I can spot more differences to that one than Dulce.

It felt sickening at times especially since the weather has been warmer. Now that it has had a chance to macerate, I am absolutely loving the scent. This is definitely gourmand and I don’t own many fragrances like this but it does truly smell like a creamy vanilla melted marshmallow mixed with caramel. I feel like I would have to layer it for it to smell more elevated and I tried it with New York Nights by Bond No 9 and this just takes that fragrance to a whole other level! NYN is a new fragrance purchase I’ve been struggling with because I get more patchouli and spices than caramel and l don’t get any coffee. It almost leans more masculine for me which is why I have been having a hard time. Layering Eclair with NYN make it a lot more gourmand and sweet so that it leans much more feminine for me while making the scent much more deep and interesting. I’ve heard layering this with Tribeca is also amazing as well. This is a love for me!"

Butter macaroons are made of butter, desiccated coconut, vanilla extract, and condensed milk—which is what I’m getting. To be honest, I was expecting it to be more like vanilla milk, ice cream, and salted caramel, but they’re being overshadowed by the booming sweet coconut. I wonder how no one else has ever mentioned it before? If you’ve tried butter macaroons before, you’ll probably get what I mean.The warm butter note in this is very similar to the butter note in Let The Good Times Roll by Lush (not a dupe, just a similar note), which makes me a bit nauseous if I sprayed too much.Overall, this wasn’t bad, just not what I was expecting (like I said, I initially was looking forward to some caramel milkshake with whipped cream-ish type of scent).P.S.

After I let this dry down for more than 3-4 hours - it’s getting better, sweet warm lactonic vanilla scent. However, I can’t tolerate that rubber smell for 3-4 hours 💀As it’s only manufactured in June 2024, I guess I have to let it sit and maturate for awhile. Heard this smells exactly like beast mode Bianco Latte so I want to try it before buying the real deal. Lattafa is always my favourite perfume brands and I have more than 5 Lattafa perfumes where I blind bought all of them. This is the first one that I am quite disappointed but I will put faith in the maturation.Also, every time I close the cap - there is this orange color substance around it. I have to rub it off with tissues so I wanna check if anyone experiences the same thing like me? I’m afraid to spray it on my skin now…Will edit this if I change my mind.

As a devoted fan of Bianco Latte, I was curious and intrigued by the affordability of this scent. I half expected it to require some time to mature, but from the very first spray, it perfectly mirrors Bianco Latte, delivering the same exceptional performance.For those unfamiliar with the scent profile, both Eclaire and Bianco Latte are straightforward, linear, sugary vanillas with a rich, creamy texture. They may not be the most complex fragrances, but they excel as pure vanillas and are perfect for daily wear.Obtaining Bianco Latte has always been a challenge for me, so discovering Eclaire, which is readily available and costs less than half the price, has been a significant relief. Thank you, Lattafa. You won me over with Yara, and now you've captivated me even more with Eclaire."

It’s a more creamy caramel vanilla and you can’t stop sniffing it! But I can’t apply it on my skin because I am allergic to the alcohol they used somehow. I highly recommended!

I have a true vanilla perfume from Guerlain boutique and always on the look for something that would wow me since that one was discontinued.I will update once i sprayed the air out of the bottle. So far, I smelled the smoky like cigarette same as Supreme vanilla from Zara… I emptied the air in the garden and caught a whipped after 30 hours back to where I sprayed, I smelled floral note! It’s weird since I didn’t see any comments here and I originally didn’t realize it got white floral note in the middle note!So I hope that tobacco scent will go away because I have to stop using many perfumes since Tabasco is a very common note to give a touch w the boost to the end note of many fragrances…"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Lattafa, you did it again. I am beyond astonished. I have the original Bianco Latte and I swear, hands down, this smells 1 to 1 like Bianco Latte. I sprayed both on each of my hands and I can not tell a difference. Well, the only actual difference is, Eclaire doesn't have that first alcoholic smell that you get at the first whiff of Bianco Latte. Honestly, Eclaire holds way longer too, which is kinda sad towards Bianco Latte, as that one is pretty pricey. I sprayed a little too much of Eclaire in my excitement and couldn't stop smelling it for 3 hours straight. But that was my fault Honestly. So pro tip, don't spray too much if you don't want to knock out everyone around you or give yourself a headache. But yes, this is by far Lattafas best perfume and this will be my signature scent from now on. I will repurchase this till they decide to discontinue it. I will never let go of it"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Alright, eclaire! Been hearing about this one through the grapevine so been dying to try it. It is really worth testing a few similar genres in one go as you really feel the nuances, the differences. This one reminded me of pink sugar at first sniff but with an added almost burnt waffle cone. Definitely a kind of synthetic burnt smell to it, which can translate as an edgy gourmand, or toasty waffle. But if you're not in the mood it can also come off as a slight burnt tyre. So probably most similar to me to the black pink sugar of the series. I'm not feeling like I need to buy a bottle of this at all, not to say it's not good, but I'm actually relieved as I fall in love with every other thing I'm sampling. This one has a roughness to it that some less expensive arabic perfumes can have, and I'm not feeling it today. Interestingly the other two I'm sampling have started to show their floral / feminine nature more after having smelled this one. Really worth testing a few at a time!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Never smell Bianco Latte since Giardini Di Toscana is not available in my country. I have no idea what it smells like.Got sample of Lattafa Eclaire and Paris Corner Taskeen Caramel Cascade along with other fragrances last week. These are the scents that get hype recently. I ordered them to see what they are smell like.Eclaire smells like vanilla pastry cream. Sweet but not cloying and has some 'clean' undertone. Projection is good in the first 2 hours then becomes skin scent and longevity is good. About 7 hours+ on my skin and stays on clothe to the next day. Not the type of scent that I would wear outside but I definitely enjoy wearing when I go to bed. It's very comforting.If you want something bolder, Caramel Cascade smells very similar but stronger is every aspect. Crazy projection and last forever. Good fragrance but too loud for my liking so I prefer Eclaire.Below is my additional opinion.Few weeks ago, I watched a reriewer on YouTube reviewing this Eclaire and ended up with telling people to get a real one (BL) instead and I also found some comments here suggest the same.This is interesting 'cuz when some people review dupe fragrance and they don't like it they just said something like 'it's not the same, smells cheap, less complexity' etc.I don't really see the review that tell people to 'get the real one' mainly because of the price.So, out of curiosity, I googled for BL's price and ...woah ....$180-$200 for full bottle (about $135 in the brand's website but does not include shipping cost) while Eclaire, in my country costs about $35-$40. That is HUGE price difference!For people who said ""get the real one"", you need to understand that not everyone can afford $200 fragrance.If you are comfortable with paying $200 or more for a bottle of fragrance, good for you. You are rich!If you don't like dupe or cheap fragrances, it's totally fine. Smell is subjective and people should respect others' opinion.BUT please do not tell people to spend their hard earned money to justify your standard.Don't ""Let them eat cake"" other people."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Upon spray, it’s lactonic with caramel and praline notes. But accompanying these notes is a weird persistent synthetic/plastic/rubber smell.Over a long period of time, this weird synthetic smell recedes, but it throws me off. Maybe I should let the perfume sit for several weeks or until winter to try spraying again as some reviewers suggested.Without the off-putting note, I think it would be pleasant lactonic vanilla."

I would say VERY much like a vanilla latte. It's so cozy and comforting. The musk is well blended and gives it class and staying power. It is very linear and I don't detect any florals. The dry down is almost like a sugar cookie.This is suitable for all ages and can be dressed up or down. The only season I wouldn't wear this is summer. Maybe on a cool evening.This is you with your favorite blanket curled up on a couch in a sunny room sipping a vanilla latte.

And then the under notes were like vanilla and caramel maybe? Very hard to tell.I was SO disgusted with the money I’ve loosed, and by the « reviews ». I couldn’t spray too near my skin, either too much.So I didn’t want to lose hope with this perfume and I was right!The second day that I’ve received the perfume, I was smelling the caramel more ! And the « Forest » smell kind of disappears. The third day was even better, I really like the scent now and I’m finally smelling a very creamy Caramel - vanilla.So for those who didn’t like it at first, let it macerate for a few days or month! And maybe from there you’d love it ! ♡The longitivity is incredible and lasts all day on my skin."

I oversprayed it HEAVILY while testing it out and really can't get any projection as far as I can tell. But it's a great scent. Comforting, milky, caramel-y, I get the honey note too.

I paid $41 US and I'm glad I purchased when I did, $60 bones for a Lattafa would definitely be a hard sell for me. Arrives Friday, will update UPDATE: arrived an hour ago and here's my immediate thoughts: I like it but it's so so similar to Dulce by Rosie Jane, Sweet Tooth and Fresh cream warm cashmere which I own all of. So I'm a little disappointed and it does smell a bit like a vanilla Yankee candle after drydown. PerfumeTok got us again! Don't get me wrong it's nice but I was expecting something more for all the hype. I'll macerate til fall to see if it deepens. Definitely vanilla tho so if you love Vanilla you definitely won't hate it but so far I'm not extremely wowed. I'm hearing if it smells like rubbery celery, that's a possible fake.

I own Khamrah from Lattafa as well, and that one is an absolute delight on my skin. The good thing about Lattafa is that their prices are not eye-watering so I don't feel too bad about a failed blind buy .I certainly intend to try other Lattafa fragrances, and I plan to concentrate on the ones which are reviewed as ""long lasting"".

If I would have to wear it or sit next to somebody who wears it in a car or any other moving thing (maybe not train or metro), I would throw up. This kind of sweetness reminds me of hot, terrible days in old USSR busses, there was a scent that made me sick in them.

Don’t get me wrong, Eclaire is definitely a dupe and an absolute steal for the price/performance. However, BL has an airiness and effervescence to it, while Eclaire is much more dense. Similar to BR540, BL does the disappearing and reappearing act when I wear it, so I only get whiffs of it throughout the day. For a fragrance this gourmand, I actually appreciate it because constantly smelling sweet, sticky caramel doused in sugar is too much for me. For people who love this scent profile, have difficulty smelling BL, or simply want a great bargain, Eclaire is where it’s at. But beware, it is UNRELENTING when sprayed on clothes."

Hope this goes away after letting it sit. I'm getting custard creams with a light background floral a little reminiscent of Olympea Solar and if you sniff deeply a bit of lactonic butterscotch. Sweet. Not very projecting, in fact I'm a bit underwhelmed for the price (for a Lattafa) Their cheaper scents are a lot stronger than this. What I sprayed on my arm 30 minutes ago has all but disappeared and not a whole lot on my shirt either. Will come back to this one.I came back. The alcohol (not booze - the medicinal type for sterilising stuff ) is still there as soon as you spray. I heard its in the other Bianco Latte dupe too, the one in the caramel coloured bottle - not sure why, I've never come across this in any other Lattafa.This one clings to clothing more than to my skin, I don't mind the sweetness, I love a sweet scent - it's just a bit too gourmand for me (and I love gourmands) and too much into the fudgy, butterscotch realm. Will hold on til the Winter and review it again."

Its me.. it must be lol.. the drydown is slightly less celeryish and my partner adores it. My nose must be broken. The drydown gives me hope. So close though. The caramel and decadent vanilla honey vibes are there for sure.. its like hearing the music from the concert while standing outside in line. The bouncer aka the celery scent won't grant the other notes passage yet.. anyway..projection statements here are true. its potent. Ill let it sit and revisit in winter."

Not cloying at all, definitely a crowd pleaser. Smells well blended brand new but I’m sure it’s just going to get stronger as it sits. As a gourmand gal this checks all my boxes"

Buut there is this very faint note that I am not so sure about, after reading some reviews I agree that it smells a bit rubbery. I will trust the recommendation of letting it sit for a while. I do not think this is a summer scent so hopefully it will be ready for fall. I couldn't stop smelling my arm because it's soooo delicious and addictive, just the rubber note is a little turn off.

On skin up to 6 hrs.Projection/Silage; this where BL wins 100%. Eclaire do not project. I have bottle for few weeks and I do not understand comments where people say its a beast mode. its not, it stays still pretty close to the skin even if I overspray. To compare with another vanilla like Nebras; if you overspray Nebras, you can fill smaller room and people will definitely smell you. BL also projects very nicely, I always get compliments when I wear it, people say that they mostly smell gourmand vanilla like from bakery.

I emptied the straw into the box. The alcohol smell does dissipate once I sprayed it on my skin. But overall, if you love sweet, caramel, lactonic fragrances, get this one.

It has some subtle Killian DNA even though it’s a Bianca Latter clone. It reminds me a lot of Princess, without the spice.I completely forgot to check my manufactures date :/ but I think this may be a fairly new bottle so it’s a bit light and linear. Very straight forward sugary vanilla cookie. It doesn’t have much caramelization to me, nothing browned or buttery about it. It smells like sugar cookie without the lemon. Or a snickerdoodle without the cinnamon and nutmeg. A very light skinned cookie with no brown crunchy edges lol. Very lactonic with a hint of musk and white flowers. I hope with time the caramel and praline notes develop and deepen to make it more interesting.Straight out the box, although I love it, it’s have to be a layering scent for me. It’s too linear and straightforward and I prefer a hint of complexity in my gourmands.

All day long I keep getting whiffs and it’s absolutely lovely.I cannot wait until fall/winter because I think it will shine in cooler weather. Highly recommend."

It gave me everything I was hoping for with taskeen Caramel Cascade.It's well blended despite the milk notes. I often feel milk notes smell rancid on me, however this one gives the same sweetness of milk and honey.I have a relatively new bottle so I'm hoping it macerates and I get more than the Caramel, milk and honey.The vanilla here isn't screechy or fake but blends well with everything else. It's a bit linear for now, but I expect that to change."

It’s not bad, I don’t own BL, but if this is similar… well I wouldn’t splurge. On me it opens very vanilla heavy, then turns into a buttery shortbread cookie, which later gives way to a sugar and musk scent. It has a fluffy, light and airy quality, and even is a little nutty, which isn’t bad, but it somehow doesn’t appeal to me that much. It even reminds me of Kayali Yum Pistachio a little.While the notes are present, and the scent is okay, it just smells a little cheap. I’ll let it macerate and will revisit, but, as of now, it’s just okay.The dry down is much better than the head notes though."

Can’t wait until it macerates. Replying to reviews below, I think dulce de leche is a pretty accurate description, or dare I say gingerbread cookies?? It does not smell exactly like Sweet Tooth, and it is also different from Eilish no.1 (I like this more, it’s sweeter). I wish I had BL to compare but it’s too expensive for me and I am sooo happy knowing that people think this one is identical! I don’t usually feel called to write reviews but I’m a gourmand girly who has trouble finding the right “cookie” scents. I will say I prefer “childish” scents over mature ones- but I really just was to smell edible. This hits the mark for me."

The first 2 hours are unbearable and headache inducing but I can’t stop sniffing my arm once it’s settled in. The dry-down is so addictive that I’ll have to try it again in the colder weather. I can usually never smell a perfume on me after 6+ hours due to nose-blindness but this one has insane longevity. Smells basically the same as Bianco Latte to my nose and I had similar wear-time & sillage on both so I mostly copy-pasted my thoughts on Bianco Latte to Eclaire. Well done, Lattafa!1 WEEK UPDATE: The first spray doesn’t smell cloying anymore! I still prefer the dry down but it’s not as bad as when I first bought it."

This smells so delicious and yummy and tasty, omg! The Silage is amazing, the projection is phenomenal, the performance is outstanding! I enjoyed wearing this fragrance. It smells so creamy and sweet and I can definitely smell the caramel, sugar, and milk for sure. I smell white flowers as well, but it's subtly which I like. The vanilla is there, but not too overpowering. The honey is there a tiny bit, but that's okay with me because I'm iffy about honey notes. This fragrance stayed on me for a good 4 - 6 hours which I LOVE! Very sweet and powerful. Gourmand girlies will LOVE this because of the creaminess and delicious smell. I 100% recommend this to my gourmand girls, but if you're not into strong, sugary, and sweet smells, this will not be the perfume for you! Amazing perfume!"

I have no idea what it smells like.Got sample of Lattafa Eclaire and Paris Corner Taskeen Caramel Cascade along with other fragrances last week. These are the scents that get hype recently. I ordered them to see what they are smell like.Eclaire smells like vanilla pastry cream. Sweet but not cloying and has some 'clean' undertone. Projection is good in the first 2 hours then becomes skin scent and longevity is good. About 7 hours+ on my skin and stays on clothe to the next day. Not the type of scent that I would wear outside but I definitely enjoy wearing when I go to bed. It's very comforting.If you want something bolder, Caramel Cascade smells very similar but stronger is every aspect. Crazy projection and last forever. Good fragrance but too loud for my liking so I prefer Eclaire.Below is my additional opinion.Few weeks ago, I watched a reriewer on YouTube reviewing this Eclaire and ended up with telling people to get a real one (BL) instead and I also found some comments here suggest the same.This is interesting 'cuz when some people review dupe fragrance and they don't like it they just said something like 'it's not the same, smells cheap, less complexity' etc.I don't really see the review that tell people to 'get the real one' mainly because of the price.So, out of curiosity, I googled for BL's price and ...woah ....$180-$200 for full bottle (about $135 in the brand's website but does not include shipping cost) while Eclaire, in my country costs about $35-$40. That is HUGE price difference!For people who said ""get the real one"", you need to understand that not everyone can afford $200 fragrance.If you are comfortable with paying $200 or more for a bottle of fragrance, good for you. You are rich!If you don't like dupe or cheap fragrances, it's totally fine. Smell is subjective and people should respect others' opinion.BUT please do not tell people to spend their hard earned money to justify your standard.Don't ""Let them eat cake"" other people."

My first impression was… okaaaaaaaay… generic vanilla Christmas candle. It’s… fine.UPDATE 3 months later:Yup, smells awesome. Still a TINY bit candley, but who cares. I layer with this probably more than anything else these days- it’s just a good, solid, looong lasting vanilla that seems to extend the wear of what I pair it with.

With this blend, I get a condensed, sweetened coconut milk scent on my skin, though it isn’t described in the profile. And when it comes to coconut, it’s not the sexy coconut-on-the-beach vibe. As a Thai, I’m familiar with this scent profile from traditional desserts. I don’t find it groundbreaking or appealing. You need just one spray to last 8+ hours, but it can be quite nauseating in a tropical climate. It’s better when layered with a more ambery, sophisticated perfume, but I personally would not recommend this for hot weather. I’m not even sure I can finish my 2ml sample."

It’s good….. But I think my batch was made last month 05/24 and needs to sit a while. It’s very strong alcohol in the beginning with an almost paint thinner smell that lingers a bit. I get whiffs of a sweet vanilla and a light floral but yea nothing amazing yet. Will update in a while with what happens.Update it’s 8-30-24 :The alcohol is completely gone. This fragrance is very smooth. The vanilla has really come out and the florals are gone. I can say that the sillage is lacking my initial expectation. It sits closer to the skin than I anticipated after sitting this long. Can detect it at about an arms length for the first 4 hrs after becomes more of a skin scent. I’m honestly getting tired of vanilla at this point. I feel like this year has given so many vanilla scents. I gifted this bottle to my mother who loves it.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Eclaire-93628.html,Eclaire Lattafa Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Upon spray, it’s lactonic with caramel and praline notes. But accompanying these notes is a weird persistent synthetic/plastic/rubber smell.Over a long period of time, this weird synthetic smell recedes, but it throws me off. Maybe I should let the perfume sit for several weeks or until winter to try spraying again as some reviewers suggested.Without the off-putting note, I think it would be pleasant lactonic vanilla."

Personally, I feel that is the case here. If you love it, then I love that for you... but for ME... I just don't get it!! The notes make it look so incredibly complex, but to my nose, all I'm getting is sugar. Watered-down sugar - somehow, this fragrance literally smells watery to me! I mean, I will certainly agree that the name "" (vanilla) Candy Rock Sugar"" is very fair, it does indeed remind me of those crystalized sugar sticks... but most of the listed notes I can't detect at all.. and not in the way that it's so well blended I can't single one out, just in the way of... it smells a lot more straightforward.Anywho, I do not care for this fragrance. It is quite juvenile and predictable. Longevity is almost nonexistent on my skin, can't be detected in about an hour, two at most! Since I don't care for it it's not a big issue, but if it was something I wanted to wear, that would be frustrating for certain. Also... it might just be a ME thing, but this fragrance kind of makes me feel sick... a bit nauseating, unfortunately!"

The dry down is the same. However I think people who don’t have trained noses wouldn’t even notice the difference. Or maybe if someone was wearing this in public, I’d think they were wearing la belle. Anyway, since I absolutely love la belle, I loved this too, however I won’t be purchasing a full bottle bc it would be redundant. The name is misleading tho, it’s a pear vanilla scent.

But by then it's a skin scent...UPDATE: After a few days of trying to wear this, I forced maceration using the ""Fridge"" method and the jasmine has finally been leashed/tamed. Still present...but its at least balanced with the other notes now.

I find vanilla fragrances comforting and sometimes, a vanilla fragrance helps me fall calmly off to sleep.So, I became intrigued with Kayali Fragrance's and purchased a Vanilla Sampler from my local Sephora. In the sampler are 4 x 10ml bottles: Vanilla 28, Vanilla Royale (patchouli), Utopia (coconut) and Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar.I originally visited Sephora specifically to purchase Vanilla 28. In the store and on the paper strip, I enjoyed the fragrance overall but Vanilla 28 leaned too amber and way too boozy for my tastes. Searching for a softer, somewhat more feminine application, I was moved towards other Kayali fragrances. My initial disappointment in Vanilla 28 is what led me to the sampler.So, to my surprise I really LOVE Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar and it is probably my favorite scent from the sampler! Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar is perhaps the most complex fragrance in the sampler with its mixture of floral, gourmand, sweet and other (woody) notes.On my skin, the perfume opens with an almost ""everything at once"" experience. Upon application, I immediately detect fruity pear notes, a bit of a boozy (rum) note, some light florals and lots of SWEET stuff (marshmallow, vanilla cream, etc). As the perfume wears, the sweet candied pear note pushes prominent, along with other sweets. But as an older woman, I (thankfully) do not detect much bubblegum-smile. I think the emergence of labdanum, sandalwood, cashmere, patchouli, etc keep this fragrance well-grounded...otherwise I can see this turning into a cloying, sickly, teenage, gooey mess.To my sensibilities, it makes zero sense that somehow this all works in the end. But it DOES work; and in the dry down, all the notes beautifully blend and land as sweet, slightly-floral, slightly-gourmand, gentle, mellow, musky fragrance notes. A whisper of marshmallow rises. A whisper of candied pear comes afloat. There's some musk and sandalwood, here 'n there. It's lovely.This perfume is quite beautiful, it really is. As I experienced it today, I had the thought ""I don't think I will love this forever and ever"" but for today, tonight it works!Longevity is about 4-6 hours. Silage is moderate. And the price point is great!Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar may be the full-bottle purchase from the sample bunch!"

The note breakdown are not smooth or well blended. The opening is very sweet vanilla and bubblegum which obv is synthetic. Dry down is what rumbles my stomach tho. It’s a white flower bomb with an obnoxious pachouli together with a sweet vanilla cashmeran. It’s so spiky and rough. I can get sensitive of both jasmine and pachouli so if you’re the same this is a no go.If you still like those notes, I still think this is not worth it. It still smells cheap lika any other AG or celeb frag. Don’t get me wrong, some celeb frags can be beautiful but they are not worth Kayali price tag imo.I heard the new PC Khair flanker is a dupe for this so if you like this I would check that out instead."

At first I felt like ah this one might not be what I imagined. Haha get it “imagined?”. I bought the mini size blindly because of the notes, the reviews and the bottle (it’s so pretty and iridescent I want to take it everywhere with me). It’s very classy on me, and I smell the bubblegum now. It has to dry down first. But it’s interesting. i am currently wearing this right now currently and even one of my friends said “you smell nice!”. I can smell it on me too. It’s long lasting and gets better with time. I think this all depends on your body chemistry. It’s more of a floral, bubblegum, powdery scent on me, I don’t really notice any vanilla.Update (10/6) after wearing it for a while, it’s a lil nauseating haha it does still smell nice, but maybe not a me scent. Maybe I’ll like it better if I layered it with Vanilla 28. Oh and, if you have a hangover or get migraines, I would suggest to steer clear from it until you feel better. lolIn the meantime I’m saving this one for more outgoing events."

Initially (I'll tack on my old review at the end) I didn't like this AT ALL, but going through my 'declutter' pile of samples I brought this back into the fold because it smells sooooo good from the nozzle I wanted to give it a second chance...The initial freshness from the pear and violet leaf is DIVINE, and it's such a bold & interesting contrast against the bubblegum and rum. I definitely understand why this frag is divisive, it's definitely not for the faint of heart! I still feel like this dies down way too quickly though: that airy freshness is gone after 10 minutes or so and a clove-like spiciness starts to set in, and after about 30 minutes the candylike sweetness is all but gone too leaving just the rum and spice. That later stage does stick around for a couple of hours though so from start-to-finish the longevity isn't awful, it's just a shame the top and mid notes are short-lived.Gonna use up the entirety of my sample before deciding, but I might buy a 10ml. It makes for a really nice cold weather scent which I'm lacking in since I gravitate heavily to spring/summer scents lol but the more I use it the more I'm enjoying it! Went from 'dislike' to 'love' haha. What a turnaround!Initial review:Blergh, what a disappointment. I LOVED this on paper, and almost blind bought a 10ml (couldn't test on skin as I was already wearing perfume) but apparently Boots only sell the travel sizes online - divine intervention if you ask me!This reminds me of Black Opium a fair bit??? A bit woody/incense-y, a bit sweet, and a fuckton of jasmine. And I strongly dislike Black Opium, sooooo... WHOMP WHOMP.It calms down fairly quickly - after only 10 minutes the bubblegum is already gone, but it already feels faint on application so like, lol. And I'm gutted the rum note isn't showing up at all on my skin (it did on paper). All I'm getting is a generic sweetness with a pinch of white florals.Hard pass."

Then the violet and jasmine came through (neither of which I enjoy) and the sweetness just became floral and powdery. As the base notes emerge, I only pick up on the sandalwood—maybe a hint of tonka bean, but not much.Overall, this is a somewhat charming, sweet and powdery fragrance but has too many floral and woodsy notes that outlast and overpower the sweetness which I am more partial to."

I did two wear tests… Went to Sephora tried it on and went about my day to test how it wears on the skin… perhaps it is the pear but the opening is so strong, and this was much more floral than I thought it was going to be. I’m not sure all the sweet that everyone is smelling… This smell like a very strong, floral, overpowering scent. Once it wore off about five hours later, I was left with a very nice sweet skin scent… But the other notes overpowered any kind of traditional gourmand you might think of."

This would pair great with the other Kay ali “yum”. This is sweet and safe but I must warn you the siliage is quite low it seems light. I’m smelling it right now and I really gotta stick my nose in to smell myself after I just sprayed. The actual sent profile is really nice I just wish it was more intense maybe come out with an intense version. This isn’t something I have a problem with sweet and vanilla based scents so I’m a little confused. It also reminds me of like five other sweet perfumes this is very “safe” not any risk at all. But the scent itself is beautiful I see why someone would want to have made this.

I wore this perfume and layered it with that girl by oakcha and a vanilla body oil, let me tell you i got compliments all day. I got on the bus with that scent combo and i was the only one on the bus, the bus driver complimented my scent and asked me what i was wearing. I also went to the mall with the same scent combo on the same day and two workers who served me at the registers told me i smelt so good. I would say the kayali perfume doesn't last as long when its not layered and on dry skin, but if you get the right oils and lotions, that's your one way ticket to compliments all day."

I came back to VCRS and Im definitely in love now. Im not a big patchouli girl and I think I needed to let this one grow on me. Now I adore it and have purchased a FB! First spray through the first 30 mins is sweet vanilla, bubblegum, candy, pear & whipped cream. The deepness / darkness from the patchouli stops this from being too juvenile.After 30 mins, I get more sweet powdery spiced vanilla marshmallow. Reminiscent of Kilian Love Dont Be Shy for me in the dry down. Really cool journey this fragrance takes you on. Shes addictively sexy. One of Kayali's best scents ever!It has great longevity and gets alot of compliments. Plus that iridescent bottle is just so beautiful!!. Huda Beauty has it for 15% off, definitely grab it."

I recently purchased a new bottle when Kayali finally restocked this on their website and it smells so much lighter than the bottle I bought when it first came out. The batch code on the new bottle says it was manufactured 1 month ago, and it shows. It smells a lot lighter, more citrusy, and less sweet and deep. It still smells nice, just not at its best. Thankfully I still have quite a bit of my current bottle left so I just sprayed this new one and put it away to hang around for a couple months, but I would highly advise letting your bottle sit for a while and come back to it if you don’t like it right away."

I can’t express how much this has changed after a few months.The opening smells just like a freshly popped can of cream soda, including that tingly feeling in the nose. I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing (probably the kind of thing that makes some people sneeze), but I love it. Dry down is tonka and patchouli, keeping bubblegum very much in the background. Thick, sticky sweet, and probably not hot weather appropriate.I currently have La Belle Intense on one arm and Candy sugar on the other. La Belle has probably twice the projection (and definitely lasts longer). If you replaced the florals in La Belle intense with a pinch of sugar, you’d get this. They’re almost identical in the dry down, but Candy Sugar is sweeter. It might be redundant to have both, but this is a fun, more playful alternative if you love this type of scent profile. Longevity is a couple hours."

It’s incredibly sweet, fluffy, and pleasant, but it’s just too juvenile for me. I can smell a hint of Vanilla 28, which I love. This is a more childlike version. I love sweet gourmands and this is nice, but again, it’s not a grown up scent and that’s what I prefer. The bubblegum in the beginning is delicious and it dries down to a very sugary, mildly floral, jellybean that sits very close to the skin. It’s youthful and sugary sweet."

If I had smelled it, I wouldn't have bought it. This smells like bubblegum and jellybean covered in sugar. I was expecting a bit more white-sugar version of Vanilla 28. This is just too sweet for me, it's not classy like Vanilla 28, it's juvenile. If you're over 18 years old, don't wear this. It's perfect for a teenager, very cute sugary youthful perfume. It's nice, it just doesn't suit me. I prefer more musky and floral scents with hints of sweetness, not just pure candy and sugar. The performance is actually great. Causes me a headache..."

I like patchouli so was not worried about it being present. I was wrong. This is nuclear patchouli on me, and it's like the patchouli in angel. Suffocating, overwhelming, drowns everything else out except the woody notes. I just smell wood and patchouli and a 90s like sweetness that reminds me of elizabeth taylor white diamonds which shares notes of patchouli, sandalwood, and ylang ylang so maybe that is why this reminds me of it. This would not go away. Lasted 8+hours on me and very strong. The dry down was even more patchouli. I have no idea if I got a bad batch, I see some others who mention a similar experience. Could not give it away fast enough, luckily only purchased the travel size."

The top notes were what I was hoping for/ they’re the best bubblegum smell ever! Then immediately it settles into a whipped almond vanilla marshmallow crème… and I’m not really feeling it. I’m disappointed 😔 it’s a very milky almond vanilla and it’s soft. I don’t think it agrees with my chemistry- most kayali fragrances don’t do well with my skin. As it dries down I do smell the La belle in it- definitely La belles kid sister… it’s the sweetness that whispers in La belle that you wish was stronger- it’s flipped- it’s that sweetness intensified in the forefront with the La belle main scent in the background.When I say almond vanilla I’m not talking about a nutty almond- no the sweet overly sweet almond vanilla borderline medicinal.

I gave in and bought 10ml ver of Vanilla candy rock sugar it is quitee similar to la belle. So if you already have it you can skip this one. But this is more brighter and fluffier than la belle. It opens fruity with the pear and sugary, then after a lil while it is marshmallowy..kind of bubble gummy and as it dries down it gets a little sexy. Rn the longevity is 6hrs at 4th hour it is skin scent. Hope the longevity gets better with time. The juice is yummy.

I'm also a huge fan of violet and pear, so the fact that the vanilla cream & marshmallow is entwined with those notes is a winning combination with me - it keeps the gourmand blend soft and lightly sugared, but not anything that I'd consider overwhelming.I don't detect anything that makes me think of bubblegum, though perhaps there is something similar to a Jellybean; I'd describe the accords as a gentle fruity mix which I can't quite identify, but reminds me of strawberry laces and those boiled rhubarb & custard sweets. It complements the light veil of jasmine and ylang-ylang nicely - any other florals that might be present are too subtle for me to be able to detect.The remaining sugared vanilla and fruity/floral mix is gradually wrapped up with a blend of tonka, caramel, vetiver & musky sandalwood. Labdanum is sweet and musky, so maybe there is some there strengthening the base blend, but I couldn't swear to anything either way. I also can't often clearly detect the rum or the patchouli and when I do, it is mainy during cooler days.I can't give an average weartime or a reliable projection range for Vanilla Candy, because I only register the fragrance in brief waves - I've received compliments on it around 6 hours after application and get the odd wave after a day of wear [9+ hours], but I don't like giving a concrete weartime. Its such a shame that the rum and patchouli notes aren't stronger as I really believe that they would boost the other scent notes - in fact I now only wear Vanilla Candy when I'm layering it with richer fragrances, Vanilla Royale being my favourite."

I'm not usually a sugary, candy-scented type of person, but part of me felt nostalgic and based off of some reviews, this scent makes you feel like a kid again, so I went ahead and bought it, What a pleasant surprise! This is beautiful!I pick up a creamy sort of bubble gum scent, not a super girly bubble gums scent, if that makes sense? The drydown is beautiful too, a delicate sweet violet scent. It reminds me so much of some perfume I had in the mid 2000s and it isn't too sugary sweet either which I love. I couldn't' stop sniffing my arm when I wore this. Is it Halle by Halle Berry I'm thinking of, that smells like this?? I used to love that perfume, but it has long since been discontinued. Glad I took a chance on this."

The notes are all there. I get sugary-fruit aka candy, and the sweetness lingers longer than the fruit so it becomes a genuine cotton candy scent to me. My friend gets Fruit Stripe gum, and I could agree, but beyond that I won’t say I detect a bubble gum scent. (Ultra Male by Jean Paul Gaultier does smell like bubblegum to me.) It is too fruity to call it a vanilla scent, but I love it as a fluffy candy gourmand."

I tested this in beauty store and couldn’t smell besides all the reviews mentioned it smelled like JPG Le Belle. I have Le Belle Le Parfum 100ml but I pulled the trigger and got the mini to try.I got the bubble gum and jelly beans the first opening notes for few seconds. Then the candied pear note w syrup just like Le Belle dna kick in. However I am a bit unsure as it’s wearable and not as strong as Le Belle. Not interms of the longevity but more the intense.. Le Belle got a bit deeper scent that could be a bit heavy for summer but I would say this one from Kayali is an uplifted version that won’t choke you and you can smell a bit of vanilla 28 Kayali signature accord in the background. I love it. Will get a full size 100ml for sure.

I'm always cautious of fruity fragrance because they can give me a headache. I usually look for pear or apple. The seem to be the least offensive. Pear seems to be one of those rare fruity notes that can provide some longevity without being citrus.I'm really enjoying this the more I wear it.For me there's something very effervescent about this. On the opening I almost get a pear wine spritzer. I also get the sugar. I get the jelly beans and tutti-frutti bubblegum. The patchouli is very fresh and light. I also get the ylang-ylang.On the dry down it's pear, sugar, subtle woody/amber/vanilla and patchouli.It pairs well with other vanillas.It doesn't last as long as some of my other Kayali fragrances but these fruity notes have a tendency to be that way unless they're bergamot."

The first spray is 100% pure bubblegum and jelly beans. The dry down is identical to La Belle. It's so fun, yummy and pretty. It lasted pretty long on my skin... about 6 hours. Usually perfumes will only last like 3 hours max on my skin so this is pretty good. It's also a bit powdery which I'm usually not a fan of but one thing I've noticed is that Kayali makes powdery smell so good to my nose. It's the similar sweet powdery-ness found in Pistachio Gelato. Both have more of a Smarties candy powder smell than a baby powder smell.If you like Ariana Grande and Britney Spears perfumes you'll for sure like this. Kayali perfumes always remind me of both of their perfumes except Kayali smells fancier and a bit more mature to me. If Ariana & Britney perfumes are a girl in her teens and early 20s, then Kayali is a girl in her mid 20s to early 30s."

This smells like jelly beans and bubblegum, all on a bed of weird patchouli coupled with 50 unnecessary notes that translate to a very floral vanilla. It’s entirely too powdery and the strong base notes distract from the sweetness. She should have replaced the chewing gum and jelly beans with an authentic pink rock candy note and spun sugar. I know a I would’ve fallen in love.The drydown is very close to bourbon vanilla by Nest."

However, this is what I'm thinking so far.It opens very fruity with a lot of sugary pear, violet and a bit of vanilla. This opening is pretty good. As you get into the mid-drydown the rum comes out a little bit more with the caramel taking a sweet turn to this scent. As you get into the drydown there isn't as much going on I feel and there's just a sweet patchouli with some woods. It's very playful and young, for the teenage demographic. I don't see a mature or corporate person wearing this scent into the office or something like that. This fragrance is for school, something that gets you compliments from you friends or peers.I think this is a very nice fragrance for layering and I personally think its great for the colder months. I couldn't see myself wearing this is summer. Possibly spring but most likely not. If you're a person who likes the Kayali fragrances and Kayali DNA then this is a safe blind buy. If you tend to go for more mature and serious fragrances, I would try before you buy; you might not like the sweetness of it. If you're wondering what this smells kinda similar to, I think it smells a bit like MFK's Gentle Fluitidy Gold. They aren't dupes by any means, just similar. I'd say GFG is like the boss babe mature older cousin once removed to Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar.As someone who likes all kinds of fragrances and doesn't tend to go for a certain scent profile, I really enjoy this fragrance and I see myself wearing it a lot when I'm at school and out with friends. For me this is an easy wear and I see myself rebuying the travel size at least once more.EDIT:okay so today I layered this fragrance with Delina and Choco Musk and it gave me a slight headache but also kinda smells a bit like Delina Exlcusive. So even though this a great layering fragrance I would be careful with what it gets layered with. I've never gotten a headache from Delina or Choco Musk so I'm assuming it's some combination of these three fragrances that caused me a headache."

I test perfumes for weeks or months sometimes before I commit.I love sugary fragrances and this one hits the mark, although I have to say, it’s rather pointed/sharp sweet than a fluffy, creamy sweet. You don’t really get that creamy effect until dry down.At first spray its cotton candy being spun right in your face and sprinkles of pear flavored pop rocks. As it dries, it turns into a soft, creamy, bubblegum vanilla which is lovely. I get compliments often when I wear it.It doesn’t have a lot of longevity. I’d say 4 hours… but I love to spray it again anyways and go on that whole carnival ride again.If you have a sweet tooth, try this one."

There is kind of a balance between all the fluffy sugary notes, some lighter florals and those heavy base notes, but it ends up giving basic designer fragrance on my skin. I love fluffy gourmand scents, so I'm not excited at all with how this plays on my skin. It's just meh."

I was gonna betray Boardwalk Delight for this and make it my new signature because from owning Yum Pistachio i know Kayali perform better.So sad to report i was pretty disappointed. This is like my 4rth time trying it out and it just falls so flat to my nose. It’s just smells like generic sweetness, with a synthetic element. Reminds me of a reject pile at B&BW. I can’t explain it but you know how B&BW tries to do dessert type gourmands but always end up w a pretty severe musky undertones, Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar is like a buncha those body sprays just spilled together on the factory line and just became one sweet, musky generic mess.Im genuinely sad about this and i so wish i could smell whatever it is that people who truly love it smell.

I’m also not getting any vanilla from this perfume, not sure why it’s called “Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar” when “Candy Rock Sugar” would suffice. Maybe it’s just me, but I found the title to be a bit misleading. I’d imagine this would make the perfect graduation gift for a young woman who just finished high school or someone who is 18-24 in general.

On my skin, this opens with a sugary blast of bubblegum and jelly beans, then dries down to a delicious vanilla candy bubblegum scent. It lasts at least 6-8 hours, and doesn't leave behind the unpleasant masculine notes I smelled on the paper tester.I disagree with those who say this is Vanilla 28 with bubblegum.

It is sweet in the same vein as Britney Spears' Fantasy, JPG's La Belle and Aquolina's Pink Sugar. You'll either love this fragrance or find it incredibly sickly and headache-inducing.I feel that in my 30s, I am not the targeted audience for this fragrance. There is no doubt in my mind that as a young woman in her late teens, Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar would have been a go-to in my collection, and I would possibly have sprayed it in such abandon that everyone around me would be running for the hills. In moderation, Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar is quite pleasant, but admittedly I wouldn't wear this fragrance now that I have matured. I find this scent to be quite young, and borderline juvenile.Kayali fragrances are not necessarily affordable, and I would say that their prices are very mid-range. Seeing that cheaper fragrances and celebrity scents almost replicate Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar's sweetness, I personally would go for the cheaper alternatives. I can, however, vouch for the excellent longevity and performance, lasting approximately 7-hours on skin and fabric."

And I didn’t like it when I first tried it. It does open up loud, fruity, and sweet— almost like a tart yet creamy dessert but this fruitiness calms down after a few minutes. Baby powdery lipstick accord is noticeable at some point but it dries down to a fluffy marshmallow sugary vanilla. I don’t remember how La Belle smells like but I am reminded of Black Opium Le Parfum because of the vanilla-patchouli accord but this one is a light version of it. I find it light enough to be a cute summer vanilla on hot summer nights but it’s lovely for year round. It lasts pretty long too; I wore it to the movies and I noticed it again whenever my hair moved around the next morning."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kayali-Fragrances/Vanilla-Candy-Rock-Sugar-42-92258.html,Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar | 42 Kayali Fragrances perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Very similar to JPG La Belle but without sparkling pear and this nuancing tone in the dry down. Whereas La Belle is more aromatic and sweet, ideal for colder weather (spring), this one is more toned down, and close to your skin, more for warmer spring/summer days. It will mix well with Vanilla 28 and Utopia."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kayali-Fragrances/Vanilla-Candy-Rock-Sugar-42-92258.html,Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar | 42 Kayali Fragrances perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I bought a bottle of this after smelling it at the store. I THOUGHT I liked it. It’s very sweet. I get a ton of vanilla, of course, the candied pear is quite strong, bubble gum, the tonka, a bit of booze, patchouli, something almost caramelized, even smoky. It’s verging on cloying for me. I’m a bit drawn to it but it’s just not me. It’s way too heavy. Of course the fact that it’s hotter than Hell here doesn’t help its case either. Maybe in cooler moths I’d like this more. My guess about this fragrance is that they heard the criticism about Pistachio Gelato being too light and thought “if the people want a thick heavy gourmand let’s give it to them.” Mission accomplished I guess. However, this also has a deeper smoky tonka base much like La Belle so keep that in mind. Too smokey for me. For whatever reason this did not react with my skin well and just became oppressive on me. It ended up being a scrubber for me."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kayali-Fragrances/Vanilla-Candy-Rock-Sugar-42-92258.html,Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar | 42 Kayali Fragrances perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Just a little review to share that the dry down of Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar actually reminds me a bit of KKW Kimoji Hearts WIFEY in the yellow heart bottle. The dry down also reminds me of Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb. Of note, Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar opens quite sweet and sugary almost like cotton candy, however these top notes are very fleeting and only last a few moments. The dry down is very different with hints of honey and patchouli coming through which remind of of WIFEY and FLOWERBOMB as well as La Vie Est Belle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kayali-Fragrances/Vanilla-Candy-Rock-Sugar-42-92258.html,Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar | 42 Kayali Fragrances perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I found the note structure of this fragrance to be somewhat overwhelming and not entirely accurate. It opens with a synthetic, ""pink"" sweetness, reminiscent of bubblegum or cotton candy. This quickly evolves into a thicker profile where white caramel, vanilla, and marshmallow come to the forefront. I detect no hints of pear, patchouli, ""jellybean,"" or rum (why must Kayali add rum to everything?).The vanilla in this fragrance is similar to that in Vanilla 28—pure, thick, and almost food-grade. However, the drydown introduces a distinct makeup-powder-lipstick accord, likely from the violet leaf and sandalwood. This aspect reminds me slightly of Sol de Janeiro 59, which essentially combines vanilla frosting with a makeup scent. This makeup and baby powder accord significantly elevates the fragrance for me, as I am a fan of powdery, fluffy vanillas.This scent is far from linear, smelling drastically different at the opening compared to the drydown. Be sure to give it a couple of hours to settle before forming an opinion. Personally, I love it, and it complements my signature scent, Vanilla 28, perfectly.P.S. I'm aware that some Middle Eastern scents require maceration, so I'm curious to see how this one evolves over time. My Vanilla 28 definitely improved with age. Additionally, I own La Belle Parfum, and it smells nothing like this. La Belle Parfum is best described as a rich, leathery, sweet pear pie. It's a beautiful scent, but it isn't remotely comparable to this fragrance."

But! It doesn't have that candylike sweetness that I expected given the name and the notes. I know a lot of people think Kayali scents are too juvenile (which I can understand to point), but tbh I don't find that the case with this one. Much like Phlur's Mood Ring, I felt like it didn't quite achieve what they were aiming for. It's almost like La Croix, where it's that essence of flavor - I can kinda get the essence of bubblegum, of rock sugar, jellybean if I REALLY smell hard enough, but it doesn't feel like those notes are solid.I get a lot more of the marshmallow than bubblegum, if any at all. There's a nice crispness from the pear but its light enough to not be overpowering. The base and dry down are very warm from the rum, patchouli, and vanilla. It's very similar to Vanilla 28 in that way. Do I need both? Hard to say.I wish they skipped the patchouli in this one, I feel that would've helped set it apart from others in the Kayali line. Also I'm missing the candy and bubblegum I was hoping for, so I'm a little bummed! I wanted something sugary sweet for the summer!Overall I do enjoy it and may pick up a mini bottle when I finish my sample since despite my criticisms I don't quite have anything like it yet."

If you like Britney Spears fantasy, hypnotic poison and those gourmand early 2000's scents; those sugared vanilla's, then this would be a super safe blind buy for you. Personally I think this is best suited to cooler climates - it would possibly be too sweet and sickly for the summer!"

But I decided to sample first, as usual. I imagined something more cotton candy/marshmallow like. The scent is dominated by pear, vanilla and something boozy.

This smells amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect and the description made me think it might be too juvenile for me but after trying it, I was pleasantly surprised. The opening is very sweet with the pear, vanilla and bubble gum, etc. but the wear down is where it's at. Still sweet and marshmallowy but there's also another note that gives it maturity and kind of reminds me of the newer Black Opium Le Parfum. Huge compliment getter, loooove!!!"

Having blind bought the perfume based on its advertised notes, I found them to be quite misleading upon opening. My initial reaction was one of disappointment; the scent projection was minimal, and it distinctly reminded me of pear juice. It wasn't a terrible smell, but it was certainly not what I expected. Smelled like more average version of la belle.My opinion shifted after allowing the fragrance to macerate. Over time, it developed into a delightful blend of sweet pear syrup and vanilla cream, balanced with an ethereal sweetness. This transformation revealed a scent that was not overly sweet, but rather like a magical dessert from a fairy tale, with a hint of mystery. It doesn't carry a juvenile or overly sugary vibe, avoiding the common pink sugar scent profile.The fragrance, despite its initial shortcomings, matured into a sophisticated and formal scent that even my parents, who generally dislike sweet perfumes, found appealing. It's a compliment getter, which speaks volumes about its appeal. The longevity of the fragrance is quite impressive, though the sillage remains poor – not the worst, but it could definitely be better.In conclusion, Kayali Vanilla Rock Sugar Candy eventually won me over with its unique and mature sweetness, can be really pleasant and formal despite the initial vibe it gives off. May not be everyone’s favourite and definitely doesn’t not suit everyone as a signature scent, but it’s still lovely and likeable by almost everyone!"

What a fun, beautiful gourmand!! I tried this on in-store the moment it came out and left the store empty-handed, unconvinced. But for the next several hours, I found myself sniffing my wrist every few minutes, regretting not having turned around and bought it right there.I ended up buying the cute mini bottle version on Sephora’s website, which is perfect for me because I have way too many perfumes. It smells youthful and nostalgic, but in a way that’s absolutely wearable regardless of age. I feel wistful every time I get a whiff of myself wearing this. Definitely easily layerable with other gourmands, especially vanilla scents—she steals the show."

This is the gourmand that we all needed for summer. The sweet violet note adds a powdery touch to keep it from smelling like a juvenile body spray, and the patchouli in the drydown is much softer now that the white caramel & marshmallow notes have come out. The projection and longevity have improved, I oversprayed and received 2 compliments several hours after I went nose blind. The deep drydown on my skin smells like semi sweet powdery white cake with vanilla frosting, but in a perfumey way. The pear note that everyone compares to La Belle is almost nonexistent now that all of the candy notes have macerated. It’s elegant but it’s playful too. It works for date nights and it works for brunch or errands, it’s versatile. I also think it’s perfect for fall and winter, the vanilla will shine in the cold weather. This fragrance has received a lot of hate and I highlyyyy recommend trying it for yourself after it’s macerated for a month or so, it’s so beautiful and a compliment magnet."

I have to clarify; I’m not a warm gourmand lover. I LIKE them, but I’m not head over heels. I prefer a fresher sweet fragrance! Is this incredibly fresh? Absolutely not. However, more importantly, it’s a vanilla that doesn’t smell so INTENSELY warm! The sandalwood made me think this would be a woody gourmand but I wouldn’t call it that. It’s not “warm vanilla sugar” sickly to me, it’s more arianna cloud sweet.I love the marshmallow note, you can really smell it on the dry down and it’s incredible. Marshmallow can sometimes smell a little gross in perfume but this one managed not to be. This perfume is everything I wanted and more. Bubblegum scared me to be honest… I was really nervous seeing that note and thinking it’s going to smell sickly synthetic and disgusting. Surprisingly it doesn’t at all! This perfume is the epitome of what I love being: it’s kinda weird in a good way. It’s sweet so you’ll think “Oh! yummy” and then the bubblegum hits and you kind of tilt your head. Is it bad? Nope! I’d describe it almost like when you see a fashion style you wouldn’t wear yourself but love seeing it on tiktok or the street (except I’d wear this perfume lol). It’s that FEELING! This is really a nice and pleasant candied vanilla. IT IS still a hint of warmth which I wish it didn’t have, but I just layer it with Violet Vibes by Anna Sui and get such a delicious combo it drives me wild. If you like Juicy Apple you’re 9/10 going to like this.After about 3-5 hours I truly smell that “rock candy” smell. It’s like soft sweet candies and I absolutely love it. This doesn’t last more than 6 hours on me but I’m still in love with it! The projection is also pretty good! My co workers complimented me and even my dad liked this perfume! I would say this perfume is great if you want a “warm ish” gourmand that has those candy notes."

I used to own La Belle as well and I actually like this more than that. For some reason the longevity of La Belle was terrible on me but this one lasts all day with two sprays. I find myself craving this all the time, it’s just so sweet and bubblegum-y. This might be my favorite Kayali second to Sweet Diamond Pink Pepper. And according to my gen z friends this smells amazing so if you want something sweet that smells appealing to both women and men this is a great pick."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kayali-Fragrances/Vanilla-Candy-Rock-Sugar-42-92258.html,Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar | 42 Kayali Fragrances perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Oh my god? This is literally one of the best things I’ve ever smelled?? Absolutely head over heels for this. As someone who LOVES La Belle, this is reminiscent of it.. well, parts of it, but also very different at the same.. maybe better? My current signature is actually LB, but this might’ve just become my new favorite.. like I cannot process this.. omGGG!! This is BEYOND obsession. To me, it kinda just smells like the embodiment of my favorite parts of La Belle.. that intensely sweet, juicy, syrupy, fruity, sugary, addictive, enchanting, alluring vanilla GOODNESS. This isss reminiscent of that sweetness and even comparable with its similar(ish) scent profile.. yet still being presented in its own unique way. You definitely get nuances of LB throughout, but the transition from opening to dry down is not as drastic in Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar for me and is way more up my alley. Instead of it becoming kinda ambery and almost dusty/dry/earthy, which would happen on me rather quickly with La Belle, it’s like INSANELY cozy and marshmallowy cotton candy vanilla with juuust a touch of earthiness and some nicely appreciated depth/complexity and sexiness thanks to the base notes. Another plus is that this seems to last way longer on me than LB.. everything about this just feels like it’s intensified and sugaryyy and candieddd and turned alllll the way up to 10. Throw in a wad of bubblegum to the mix (which btw is mouthwatering) and you’ve crafted this TRULY intoxicatingly sweet scent. IMO, the sugary, cotton candied, bubblegumy marshmallowy experience is what makes this fragrance stand out on its own. You’d be silly to say LB and VCRS don’t smell even a liiiiiittle bit similar because they definitely do, but at the same time, so uniquely their own.. yet easily comparable? It’s kindaaa just perfect for me lol and I’m so glad to have both in my collection. Also I’m surprised to hear that some people have issues with longevity? Thankfully on me it lasts a solid 8+ hours! How do you describe perfection? I’m not sure… but I know what it smells like! 😍💗🍬"

However, I do not appreciate receiving and under-filled bottle. That aside, I probably would indeed pick up a full bottle, despite it being wildly overpriced given it has the staying power of a body spray. Possibly less (at least on my skin). The fragrance itself I find to be pleasant, I typically do not enjoy sweet perfumes, or gourmands, but this fragrance works for me! I can see how some people would feel let down, because I do think the expectation was for it to be much sweeter... and perhaps a bit heavier on the bubblegum. Reminds me of hanging out at the mall in the early 2000's, in the best way possible. I don't really get pear, which is unfortunate because pear is one of my favorite notes (and definitely something I was hoping to get). I get some bubblegum on spray but that seems to disappear relatively quickly. To me, it really smells like... sugar? Sugar supported by the other notes, but mostly, just sugar. Anywho, I don't find it to be particularly dynamic, but I do find it to be pleasant. If the dry down were more like the spray, I think this fragrance would be received a lot better by a lot of us!"

In the air - pure candy, delicious, vanilla, almost cotton candy-like. On my skin, it seems to dry down fast into a woody scent without much lingering sweetness. I find that there's more bubblegum and jellybean coming out when I spray it on clothing. Overall, I love it and find that it's long lasting, no single note seems too overpowering on me."

I'm usually not a fan of pear in fragrances but the pear in this fragrance meshes so well with the rest of the notes. The pear here is incredibly similar to the one in La Belle/La Belle Le Parfum but where the La Belle DNA took a wrong turn on me due to the leathery accords, this smells more gourmand and sugary with a sweet creaminess. I love that this still has a perfumey quality without smelling overly saccharine at the same time. I don't smell any patchouli or earthiness in the dry down on my skin and I'm highly sensitive to patchouli. My only qualm is that the lasting power isn't the greatest and it becomes a skin scent fairly quickly (1-3 hours) but has strong projection and sillage for the first 1-2 hours.Edit: In the deep drydown it becomes reminiscent of La Vie Est Belle's woodiness without such a prominent patchouli note.Edit 2: The more I wore this the more the dusty patchouli came out making it annoying to wear for me, personally."

On initial spray it's just too much sweet that you can't really pinpoint one note from the other. It feels like a mish-mash of sugary accords that are at war fighting for your attention.

While Vanilla Rock Candy and La Belle have some similarities, Kayali is way more smooth and rounded. Bubble Gum and Marshmallow add a bright sweetness without turning the fragrance into a girly sugarbomb. Don’t get me wrong, it is sugary and sweet but in a more mature way.The dry down is very similar to Kayali’s Vanilla 28, however the pear and bubble gum are still noticeable. If Vanilla 28 is the deep winter vanilla, Rock Candy is the brighter summery version.If you want to add some deepness, layer with Vanilla 28 and if you want to dial up the sugar and boozyness layer with Yum Pistachio."

If two scents have the same note doesn't mean they automatically smell the same. People should be a little smarter with their votes.I have a 10 ml of this and I'm surprised not many people voted for the similarity with Vanilla 28. After all, even Mona said Vanilla Candy is supposed to be Vanilla 28's younger sister. And she is right. The dry-down is 99% similar. And that's the longest lasting phase in a fragrance's evolution.I think most people spray fragrances on paper and don't wait for them to evolve before forming their thoughts and spread them on the internet.Don't expect a childish scent - this is not it. This is flirty and fun with a predominant middle-eastern core. The bubblegum is there but it's not your strawberry bubble gum: it's a cinnamon one! I grew up in Italy in the 90s and I vividly remember an older relative bringing some cinnamon chewing gums from America; sadly, I don't recall the name. This fragrance is playful until it becomes mysterious and a little dark in true Arabic fashion. What really stands out to me in this fragrance, after the bubblegum/candy notes dissipated, is a lot of labdanum. In fact, this fragrance is very incense-y and very sweet, scent profile that's totally up my alley. The labdanum is the most powerful note in the composition and this is something I personally appreciate.I like it very much so far."

This is literally one of the best things I’ve ever smelled?? Absolutely head over heels for this. As someone who LOVES La Belle, this is reminiscent of it.. well, parts of it, but also very different at the same.. maybe better? My current signature is actually LB, but this might’ve just become my new favorite.. like I cannot process this.. omGGG!! This is BEYOND obsession. To me, it kinda just smells like the embodiment of my favorite parts of La Belle.. that intensely sweet, juicy, syrupy, fruity, sugary, addictive, enchanting, alluring vanilla GOODNESS. This isss reminiscent of that sweetness and even comparable with its similar(ish) scent profile.. yet still being presented in its own unique way. You definitely get nuances of LB throughout, but the transition from opening to dry down is not as drastic in Vanilla Candy Rock Sugar for me and is way more up my alley. Instead of it becoming kinda ambery and almost dusty/dry/earthy, which would happen on me rather quickly with La Belle, it’s like INSANELY cozy and marshmallowy cotton candy vanilla with juuust a touch of earthiness and some nicely appreciated depth/complexity and sexiness thanks to the base notes. Another plus is that this seems to last way longer on me than LB.. everything about this just feels like it’s intensified and sugaryyy and candieddd and turned alllll the way up to 10. Throw in a wad of bubblegum to the mix (which btw is mouthwatering) and you’ve crafted this TRULY intoxicatingly sweet scent. IMO, the sugary, cotton candied, bubblegumy marshmallowy experience is what makes this fragrance stand out on its own. You’d be silly to say LB and VCRS don’t smell even a liiiiiittle bit similar because they definitely do, but at the same time, so uniquely their own.. yet easily comparable? It’s kindaaa just perfect for me lol and I’m so glad to have both in my collection. Also I’m surprised to hear that some people have issues with longevity? Thankfully on me it lasts a solid 8+ hours! How do you describe perfection? I’m not sure… but I know what it smells like! 😍💗🍬"

The overall scent is pleasant, but now groundbreaking or super unique. I don’t think bubblegum notes are for me, as I’ve tried Skylar’s Boardwalk Delight and I’m not too fond of that one either. I was worried that this Kayali would be way too sweet to wear when I saw the notes on the box, but (and I can’t believe I’m saying this) the usual issues I have with Kayali performance actually work here. If this was a beast mode fragrance, it would simply be too overwhelming. The lack of intensity makes this an ideal gourmand for the summer months.It’s a sugary and fluffy scent. That being said, it does still wear away pretty quickly. On me, it was a skin scent by hour 3 on both days. Weirdly enough, that’s when i found it more enjoyable! It was weird bc I am not a skin scent person.As for the general scent profile: If I could describe it in one word, I’d say juvenile. That’s not a bad thing at all! It’s a young and fun scent, perfect for her target market! If I had to be the fake type of poetic that people expect from fragrance reviews, I’d say it smells like cotton candy at a beach front carnival! While this isn’t my favorite release from them, I can see this going incredibly viral so I can’t wait to see that unfold if I’m being honest! Hope you guys enjoy it!"

Honestly, this scent just doesn't do it for me - it's just ""meh"". I was hoping for a fun bubblegum vibe, but that note is totally missing (Bel Rebel Bubble Gum is still the best!). Instead, it's got a strong La Belle vibe going on, which isn't really my thing. If you're a super fan of La Belle and Vanilla 28, you might enjoy this one, but for everyone else, be careful with the hype - it's just not that unique. And to make matters worse, it barely lasts on the skin and doesn't project at all, which is pretty typical for Kayali fragrances, sadly."

A swirling pink candy cloud.What I feel like I got was a burst of near minty/medicinal bubblegum immediately after spraying, but quick turn to a sharp and pungent musk and patchouli. I was glad for the poor lasting power because I didn't want that drydown to stick around for any amount of time.I feel like the type of people that are looking for bubble gum marshmallow gummy bear (as the fragrance was marketed) are not looking for heavy musky scents, especially not heavy patchouli.So I think this scent is similar to other Kayali scents - no denying they have their own brand vibe - but I wish it matched more with the marketing. In the way that Yum Pistachio was marketed as a rich and creamy nutty vanilla ice cream scent and we all got cold lemon drier sheets, Rock Candy is along the same lines of confusing marketing which is a disappointment to me."

They’re just doing their job to please the brand that pays them. The perfumers are great, but the brand clearly knows to say through their advertising exactly what people want to hear, but in reality this parfum smell so synthetic, clearly they use cheap materials and after one hour on me, the base notes are coming strong. After one hour I was left with the base notes 100% .I’m used with Chanel perfumes and they use top notch ingredients all the time, that’s why I can make the difference.To me this brand is money grabber"

If you're into that, then you'll probably like it. Gives me Vaniglia Mazzolari vibes, which is basically just a single vanilla orchid note. It's got a similar creamy, body-lotion scent like the original Cheriosa 62. Doesn't smell expensive (it's a cheap fragrance), but it's a commercially pleasing scent. Nothing special. Not offensive either. One of the better ones in the Cheriosa line though--smells more expensive than the rest, but still cheap.

The sugar and vanilla add a bit of whimsy or youth, however, so what COULD smell overly mature is instead a wistful reminiscence of a bygone era. This is perfect for retro outfits, afternoons in the secondhand bookshop, and wintry evenings with my grandkitty, a huge cuppa, and a good book. When I want something a little sweeter, this will layer beautifully with Demeter's Condensed Milk, or Solinotes Vanille.I am NOT sorry I have the smaller bottle, because it fits in my purse; which will be necessary, since this lasts as expected for a body spray. Now I need the full-size bottle and the lotion, so I can live in this all winter long."

I personally really enjoy layering YSL Black Opium Illicit Green with this one and it boosts that fragrance a lot, they go very well together.It makes me want to wear that dress that Ariel had at the end of The Little Mermaid the lavender sparkling one, that's what I imagine she was wearing coming out of the sea lol.The longevity though is not great on it's own, I find it worse than SDJ 87 a little bit, but with layering it it does help that's why I suggest using it as a layering fragrance.Overall, a 7.9/10 (I use this as a layering fragrance mostly, so I'm rating it as such)"

However, over a couple of weeks I came to LOVE this and found myself craving the smell. This is a lovely scent - it really does smell like violets crystallised in vanilla sugar, with a nice creaminess. It's not sickly to me, despite being quite sweet (I say this as someone who typically dislikes sugary, candy smells). The vanilla, sugar, and violet blend together deliciously creating a unique scent that isn't overwhelming. The longevity is pretty good for a spray - delicious little puffs of sweet vanilla and violet drift up throughout the day and make me smile. It's also versatile; I think you could wear this anywhere, pretty much any time. Really glad I tried it."

This is my first favourite in this category. It is really yummy. And it is noticeably sugary. Deep inside, the violet emerges, disappears and reappears beneath the sugary note. This is what makes this scent so mysterious. I also have '62 and '71. I think this is a step ahead of the others. Despite being a body mist, its longevity is very successful."

Bought this one at the same time as ""SDJ Cheirosa '71"" and kinda got obsessed with that salt caramel & macadamia nut one for a couple of months. Am almost out of that one, gave this one another spritz today and it immediately gave me #AutumnVibes so, I guess I know what I'll be wearing for the next few weeks (as my everyday, not particularly exciting, but pleasing to me, ""fall fragrance"").It has quite a decent sillage and really good longevity. I applied a spritz to my neck/decolletage, and one on each wrist/forearm around 4.00pm and it's still really noticeable even without moving around or holding my wrist right up to my nose. It's managing to give sweet and slightly fruity, with a deeper, headier base to it, along with some kind of aromachemical that creates something akin to ambroxan? When I applied it, the other half said ""You smell like candy floss!"" which isn't a bad thing to smell of in and of itself. He seemed to like it anyway.I love gourmands, so it made sense that I honed in on ""Cheirosa '71"" at first. Really edible smelling, gets loads of compliments. But I'm glad I held off on this one for a while because it probably would've been too much on a hot summer day, and I might've just relegated it to the back of a drawer or cupboard and forgotten about it. Turns out that, as I was getting to the point where smelling like 'toasted macadamia nut & caramel cookies' was starting to give me a toothache, I already had this one ready to go for the minute the temperatures dropped. Perfect. Current me would very much like to thank past me, for not just having the presence of mind to order both of these at the same time, but also the absence mindedness to forget all about it for a bit.So far, that's 2 fragrances from SDJ and both are really pleasant. Nothing ground-breaking, or likely to break the bank either, but something easy to reach for, that you can chuck in your bag (and being plastic, there's less chance of my clumsy arse smashing it while at the bottom of my handbag, immediately rendering the entire bag so dangerous, it becomes a SAW movie challenge, and I decide to just immolate the entire thing and leave figuring out how to replace my wallet, cards, money, make-up, everything else, to the responsibility of the me of the future - sorry future me!). Based on these I'd definitely try another couple of these cheapies - because who doesn't love having an easy-to-wear cheap body-spray on hand?? Will probably try them out in store beforehand though, because this brand seems to have some pretty polarizing iterations in the collection."

It's such a creamy, sugary floral vanilla. Instantly reminded me of vanilla ice cream. It's not gourmand at all though.This also lasts the longest for me out of the entire line to be honest. I sprayed this alone and it lingered for about 3-4 hours which is VERY surprising for a body mist. I love pairing this with Monotheme's Vanilla Blossom (EDT) and altogether lasted me a good 6-7 hours while it was hot outside.I got this about 2 months ago and tbh at first I thought it was nice and simple.

Initially I was trying to agree with these type of gourmands, but I realize I'm just not that girl lol. It's supposed to be a cheap fragrance, so I'm not that dissapointed but I think Cheirosa '62 is just better, and you should just go with that if your looking for a SDJ gourmand. If you want something different than the plain old siganture classic '62, then go with After Hours aka '76 which is not my personal favorite, but it's better than this one and earned me many compliments from people I was around (great silage, and logetivety for '76)."

It stands out from the others and I wish they had a perfume. This is soft and sweet without being harsh, round and fluffy. Its powdered vanilla and sandalwood with a floral touch in the opening. It was love at first sniff for me and I usually find sandalwood to remind me of older perfumes but something about this is just lovely. I have the mist, butter, and just ordered a perfume version from an etsy seller.Like @vanillary29 said its less sunshine kissed bouncy fun blonde it girl and more mysterious brooding raven haired shy but kind girl. Obviously I identify more with that lol! Not to be weird but for the people who like a visual description of a scent to describe it; this smells like a first kiss under a full moon in summer the scent of flowers and your vanilla perfume floating in the humid air, soft but heady at the same time."

I found the concoction so truly delightful and unique that I decided to purchase it in spite of the brand's reputation for poor longevity. You'll be frustrated that this beautiful scent requires you to keep applying repeatedly throughout the day at such a high price point, but to me that is the only flaw. There's nothing wrong with something light and subtle so long as it's priced fairly and built to last."

The sweetness became more powdery after 20 minutes. It reminds me of a perfume from Zara I once had, Violet Blossom, it was one of my favorites a few years ago."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,It smells like biscuits. Almost like graham crackers.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I'm an unabashed fan of Sol de Janeiro's Cheirosa offerings, but this one caught me off guard. While the others exude confident, main-character, hot-girl energy—especially 62 and 40—this fragrance is their alt counterpart: a brooding, shy, and introverted version. The violet lends an unmistakable gloomy and moody feel, while the vanilla here deviates from the usual caramelized sweetness, leaning instead towards a powdery note, reminiscent of makeup or lipstick. This scent is quite a departure from the typical Sol de Janeiro vibe, but it fits my style perfectly. If you enjoy Guerlain Insolence, Mancera Choco Violet, Narciso Rouge, or Kenzo Flower, you might find this intriguing as well."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I just keep getting surprised by this brand. I dislike most sweet perfumes, but sdj somehow makes it so irresistible for me.This one is my favorite out of all of them, because its so powdery and so dusty. It smells like sugar. It has some syntheticness but its not the type of fake sweetness that will give u a headache. it has more of a sugarcube quality (as listed in the notes) instead of syrupy sticky candy fruity sweetness.It has a bit of a lactonic quality as well, which is surprising since no one mentioned it. I would not consider this floral whatsoever, it doesnt smell of a garden or a bouquet or anything. It smells dusty, powdery, milky and sweet. The color perfectly of the bottle fits perfectlyThen there is the longevity. Are we sure this is a body spray? Why does this last me well over 24 hours? My skin doesnt let any eau de parfums have any lasting power but somehow this body spray lasts this long? Its wonderful really. It smells good AND is long lasting. What more could u want?Just refrain from wearing this in summer heat. It starts smelling like burnt sugar (which is really interesting and im sure many people would enjoy) and it starts being a tad screechy. But this never gives me a headache, and i am really prone to headaches when it comes to sweet perfumes"

It's a perfect vanilla spray to layer with, and similar to 40, I feel like I can wear this throughout the year.

That one is synthetic, chemical, not natural smelling. I tried pretty much all SDJ scents and this is my favorite. I need a perfume version of this asap! I have the body butter and I feel it extends the longevity of the spray. Not by much, but maybe I get a few good hrs out of the layering. Honestly, this is longer lasting that some of my very expensive niche perfumes!The scent is not ""in your face"" kinda sweet, I perceive it as a delicate, very smooth soft sugared vanilla-violet. The vanilla orchid reminds me a bit of Kayali 28. I use the butter daily and it's moisturizing , not greasy at all, despite the thicker consistency. Highly recommend"

This is cashmere+ sugar+ woods. Tbh I don't get much ""vanilla"". Very well mixed but nothing special. It's like any other cozy sugary mist you can find in BBW.

But this one is so nice and cozy that it blends well with my body chemistry. A really nice sweet cozy vanilla without it being too intense or sickly. I think it pairs really well with perfumes that have vanilla in it! Oddly enough, i sprayed the EDP of vanilla skin by phlur and it gave me the same vibes as this one but a little more basic. Overall, my favorite scent out of the entire Sol De Janeiro body spray collection!"

It's like a very creamy violet ice cream, with a hint of something masculine in the background. A kinda wierd scent to be honest, but I really like it!I just realized that this is really similar to Mojave Ghost by Byredo in the drydown. It's the violet and the sandalwood I guess. I prefer this one though, with the creamy vanilla touch (and the price)"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The fact that the company released this scent made me question everything.Their scents used to be sexy in the most sophisticated way, delectable, non offensive.This is the most sickly sweet headache inducing scent, in a very cheap way. Like cheap. If you visited a flee market selling cheap old dated, no name branded bottles that were in the sun for a few hours, that’s what you would get.It’s the 3 dollar perfume called ""femme"" in a supermarket isle.Don’t get me wrong I love me a good cheapie and the most expensive scent I own is roughly 100$.I don’t think the brand made a smart choice to stop focusing on soft gourmads and going for woody florals. No surprise the hype is lost comparing to 1-2 years ago."

I wasn't sure if I liked it but it has grown on me. It has an addictive quality even though it wobbles on the edge of being something too sweet and cheap smelling. I want to turn my nose up at that rough sandalwood note, at the toothache sweetness, but I keep craving it and reaching for my sample."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This simply doesn’t fit the Sol De Janeiro line at all, it’s not a terribly offensive scent but it’s one I tried many times and just couldn’t bring myself to like. Simply put, It just smells of sweet wood, I also don’t like the ‘40 and After Hours scents, and I think they share the same note that I dislike. I usually don’t mind woody notes but they smell so synthetic in these. The sickly sweet notes with woody notes that doesn’t mix well is just not pleasant and I’d go as far as saying this is unwearable especially on a stuffy warm summers day, whereas a lot of the other main body sprays in this line are complimented by the warm weather."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,If you're experiencing longevity issues yall need to drink water. I put this on my skin 4 hours ago and it is still strong as hell. I keep getting whifs of it. It's not my favorite smell but my boyfriend went crazy over it so I bought it. I don't know..it smells quite mature to my nose. And it does resemble twilight woods but more powdery. I'm sure if it's lasted this long on my skin it'll probably last forever on clothes. I'm not sure that I like vanilla and fruit together when its perfectly blended like this. It has to either be more fruity or more vanilla. This is blended equally.Someone said birthday Cake icing scent?....maybe if you drenched a birthday cake in cologne. This doesn't smell like birthday cake sorry it smells like a very very sweet cologne. Not perfume. Like a tooth achingly sweet cologne. Also it doesn't smell ANYTHING like pink sugar.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The weakest of the lineup, it lasts five minutes then fades to nothing. A faint floral birthday cake icing scent that withers away, but it is not that great to start with, very generic and anemic compared to the deep caramel/nutty/buttery impact of 62 and 71, or the pretty floral fruit of 68. Way overpriced and underpowered."

I love Sol de Janeiro’s scents, and this one is screaming SOL DE JANEIRO! I have two ways to describe it so far, it’s a perfect mix between Cheirosa 68 and the limited edition After hours. If you haven’t smelled the After hours mist, it’s pretty similar to YSL’s Black Opium. This mist smells like you just picked up a big beautiful perfect looking violet covered in sugary vanilla, and you inhale it. It’s a safe blind buy in my opinion. It matches the description perfectly, and it’s exactly what I imagined it to be. I’m a huge fan of 68, so I loved this one. Very floral, can’t smell much of the usual “sol de janeiro fruityness”."

The violet is there all the way. I smelled a bunch of the SDJ scents at the flea market and decided on this one. I think I perceived some beachy/tropical notes that weren't actually there, due to having sprayed some others while testing. '59 is very much in line with my tastes, but I was intending to take home something with more of a vacation vibe. I wouldn't buy this one again since it's rather expensive for a body mist, but now I have my sight set on the '62 (does that make me a 'basic bitch'? I guess I don't care 😂)P.S. This smells great layered with Je Reviens and probably many other vintages that feature violet. I would love to test it layered over Farenheit!!"

All the gourmand of the original 62 but that one is a bit too much for me. I got the sampler and 59 is bar far my favorite but it lasts all of 4 minutes- not even 5 minutes.

I sprayed it more than once on different occasions and every time it made me nauseous. It smells like warm whipped cream and cheap vanilla, loaded with sugar.Literally like rubbing whipped cream on your skin and sitting in the sun. I don’t understand why they would make space for this thing and not 39."

I truly enjoy using it, but I wish its fragrance lasted longer. I understand why some individuals may find its scent similar to playdough, which might be the reason for my nostalgic feelings towards it. However, let me clarify that this is my signature scent, and I adore it deeply. I cannot imagine my life without it. The fragrance is a delightful blend of sweet, creamy violet, and the sandalwood note resonates deeply with me.Pink Sugar, though it is heavier on licorice, is comparable to this other masterpiece, which I also adore. Orchidee Vanille has a similar scent, but it is less sweet.This fragrance is so pleasing to me that I have decided to purchase the full-sized version from the official website. After an extensive search for a signature scent, I am delighted to have finally discovered the perfect fragrance that suits me"

But sol de janeiro 59 is so weak compared to SDJ 62, it only last an hour on my skin and not even pass my lunch break (less than 3 hours) on my clothes. Not to mention it smells okay not yummy nor fresh, the projection is intimate. The scent on me smells like Byredo Inflorescence mixed with byredo bal de afrique and bunch of alcohol, very faint. In short it smells like watered down byredo inflorescence and bal de afrique. If only I can return this. Not to mention for such price, I guess BBW or VS body mist can make better product."

I was so confused; I was possibly the ONLY Person on the Planet that had mixed feelings about this Fragrance. Don’t get Me wrong in the beginning to ME it smelled Feminine; Sweet; Vanillic but it had a “aftertaste”, “foot like” note in the back. I sprayed it on Paper. After letting it sit for about 2 or 3 Weeks; I sprayed it again but on my actual Skin; and I really, really, really like it. It’s a Pretty Vanilla Floral; there’s still a note that I can’t place but it’s not terrible. As a Gourmand girl I 100% approve. I think this is a Year round scent for those who wear Scents according to Seasons.This scent is very Cozy; Energetic and Uplifting all at once.So far I’ve paired it with Burberry Goddess; Milk Expressive; Vanilla 28; Ruby Orchid just to see how it layers and I liked them all."

And I think I get that, faintly, if I squint... maybe. Mostly this smells really fudgy/salted caramel-ish on my skin. Which is delicious! I'm not even into gourmands typically but this is the kind of gourmand that keeps itself in check and doesn't become sickly sweet and headache/nausea-inducing. I'm disappointed as I was looking forward to a delicious sugary violet scent but the funny thing is I still like it! I might buy it later in the year for cold weather season :)On a final note this has shockingly good silage and longevity. This is my first time testing a SDJ spray so I don't know if that's typical for this brand but I only used one spray and could smell it even with my arm down by my side and I sprayed it 5-6 hours ago and it's still going strong!"

Overall a very pretty scent, reminds me a lot of Lira by Xerjoff mixed with Sweet Like Candy by Ariana Grande.I cannot explain it better; the vanilla mixes perfectly with the sweetness of sweet like candy and the projection of it is very similar to SLC."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I feel like I'm the only person in the world who didn't pick up on the vanilla. I smelled this before knowing the notes (or what it was supposed to smell like at all) and got more of a linen-y violet above all else. The sandalwood and violet is stronger than the supposed sugar and vanilla orchid notes. It's definitely sweet enough to not just be an herbal perfume but not gourmand/candy-ish either.I either own or have smelled most of the SDJ Brazilian crush line. I get that the vanilla notes are common in them, but why is it everyone's go-to to label every SDJ as a vanilla perfume?? maybe my nose is too shallow."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I get the violet note more than anything but there is the sweetness and creaminess of the vanilla in there. It's very much floral which I don't prefer, but the vanilla saves it for me. Layered with the eos vanilla cashmere (identical to the delicia drench body butter) it smells much more like something I'd wear without being too warm for warmer weather. The fragrance itself is definitely suited for all weather, but the longevity isn't the best."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I want to start by saying that I love this brand and have most of the SDJ body mists but this does not hit the mark for me and is by far the weakest of all of their consistent line.It is a whisper of a fragrance and does not last at all on me. I can’t smell any individual note in this but what I smell is the signature underlying smell that most of the body mists of SDJ have (the popcorn like note in cheriosa 39, 62 and 71) and in my opinion is the most similar to cheirosa 71.It also smells like a way weaker form of Sabrina Carpenter’s Sweet Tooth to me minus the ginger note.Not worth the money if you ask me, I would stick with the other body mists in their line which in my opinion are better smelling and longer lasting."

It reminds me a tiny bit, although be it a body spray version, of Mallow from Sora Dora or Insolence. Of, course it’s not anywhere near as fruity as Mallow."

Today, I've also tried the body mist and it's my next fave stuff.On my skin, it is dead on Kissing burns.. by Kilian dupe and I love it!! Especially because I am saving my last bottle of it like gold:) Milky delicate vanilla, somehow fresh on my skin with a bit of violet powderness, amazing."

Well, I wish id got the bigger bottle now! What a beautiful delicate scent, it opens up quite sweet on me, and then dries down fairly quickly to a Violet powderyness that is my favorite. The longevity isn't great on me but I got the matching body butter and that has made the world of difference. Great little fragrance, will be picking up a bigger bottle soon!"

Then the sandalwood, it's dry but it compliments and balances it out.It's not too much of a complex scent but it's nice, it's a pretty girl next door or a pretty girl in your class that doesn't wear a distinct perfume, she just smells nice, makes you believe she just was born like that.Sort of reminds me of that scent newborns have. Cozy, milky, adorable."

Not a love bc it's too sweet for me and not creamy or woody enough for me.But I'll still keep this to try some layering combo.Cheirosa 40 is better, more uplifting note and wearable for a go-to vanilla body spray."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Love, love, love this one! As a lover of violets, I know that there aren't that many violet forward scents on the market so when I saw this purple bottle, I was intrigued. Sure enough, violets were here and I adore this body spray. Get your nose of this one as you might be surprised to find out that you also like violets when they're done right. I would love to have an EDP of this. I use the body spray to soften and sweeten my other earthy violet scents that need a little help and this is perfect since it's a body spray and doesn't stifle the original scent. Sol de Janeiro really kill it when it comes to their body sprays and I hope they consider offering more EDP style fragrances. Is this a violet bomb like Insolence by Guerlain? No, but they are still here and they are candied like I like them"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This is maybe my favourite SDJ scent- it's very soft and appropriate everywhere. This has a similar softness as Scarlett Poppy intense from Jo Malone. I might add this to my collection.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My friend let me try this today in class and while I consider myself a fan of violet smells, I feel the sugary-ness of this drags the freshness of it down a little bit. It's still a unique smell, especially for the price, just wish it wasn't as sweet and was a little more fresh. I may like it more if I actually tried it on myself though."

Another time, I thought I'd try it on skin since everyone was going bonkers for it. It smells so much better on skin. It sits close the the skin but lasts for a decent amount of time. It's soft and sweet. It's quite a modern fragrance in that it's airy, not overtly floral and slightly gourmand. I enjoy it quite a lot. Very easy to wear."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Sweet, clean, powdery, breezy scent perfect for bedtime or a casual day running errands, or in the office. Inoffensive, happy, and calming. Easy reach for when you don't feel like making a bold statement. The soft purple of the bottle is the perfect color to express the scent inside.I wore a few sprays of this to bed last night and woke up still smelling it on my skin. Sits close to the skin, but still holds it's own 8+ hours later. Cheap and cheerful. I think I'll probably continue to use this as a bedtime scent this spring."

It is really weak, I can't really say what the notes are either. Good I went into Harrods to smell it before I spent my money."

The scent was so faint and I could hardly smell it even after multiple sprays on one wrist, and the little scent I could smell disappeared in 10 minutes. After a second try, I like it much more. It’s still very faint, but I can actually smell it now. It’s a light, powdery, slightly floral vanilla and it lasts about 6 hours. In terms of perfumes listed as similar—❌ Aquolina Pink Sugar: much sharper❌ Ariana’s Mod Vanilla: has a light fruity scent on me❌ Ariana’s Moonlight: super floral on me, much less sweet❌ JHAG Mmmm…: a powdery and sweet fruity scent❌ Kayali Musk 12: a very sharp musk, no vanilla❌ Le Monde Gourmand Pistachio Brûlée: a lightly nutty vanilla, no florals❌ Oakcha Blue Velvet: an oud and rose scent❌ Phlur Vanilla Skin: doesn’t have the floral I get here❌ SDJ Carioca Crush: a fresh fruity scent❌ Tru Fragrance Vanilla Potion: not floral heavy"

It has 3 of my favorite notes in it. Another customer warned me that it's too soft and doesn't last. She can't smell it at all, so it's a good thing it's cheap and I'll buy the larger 240ml bottle next time. The physical shop only had the 90ml bottles.It's a cool almost cold and rainy Spring day and 59 is so beautiful on me and I love sandalwood though that's just a whisper. I'm always complimented when I wear scents with violet in them and this smells like candied violet on my skin."

I think it's mostly ethyl maltol, but I really like ethyl maltol. It smells basically like toasted sugar. But this in particular also smells a little bit like wisteria flowers. Like dew on wisteria flowers. I really like it. It doesn't seem as strong as their other scents though."

I tested this at Sephora and was blown away - I loved the warm sweetness of it. Not gourmand but an extremely warm, sugary floral that lasted ALL day on my arm. Sexy and beautiful. I ordered a bottle of it from the SDJ website and it lasts 5 minutes on CLOTHES? If even that. And has a weird cigarette smell when first sprayed? It's not even like the same fragrance. Maybe it needs to macerate for a bit but right now I'm feeling very disappointed."

I tend to dislike sweet perfumes because they become too cloying and make me nauseous as time goes on, but for some reason, this one doesn't have the same effect on me. The sugary violets smell amazing and comforting, and the hint of woody sandalwood tones down the sweetness just right.Sadly, it doesn't stick around long on my skin, but it lasts pretty well on my clothes. I like to spray it on my clothes and blankets before bed. It's so cozy, and I can still catch a whiff of it when I wake up in the morning."

I have yet to try other SDL fragrances so I don't have much to compare it to but 59 is subtle and fluffy and well-blended. The sugared violet note is fantastic, it gives depth to an otherwise generic vanilla scent. I definitely want to try it layered with the lotion and a complimentary perfume (maybe Clean Reserve Skin, Mod Vanilla or Kenzo Flower) to extend its mileage. Nothing groundbreaking but it'll be a perfect dumb reach. Fans of violet and vanilla will love this (it was a blind buy for me and i love both)."

Similiar to other sol de janeiro fragrances, reeks of alcohol first, then turns into an unpleasent mix of violet and sugar. May appeal to girls aged 12-16 but is not for young adults and those who are older in my opinion. Lasted 2 hours on my wrist."

I could hardly smell a thing, but a faint distant frosting smell. However blasted with alcohol first. It's the weakest of all the Sol de Janeiro's and IMO not worth the money. If you like this scent you can get almost the same, but stronger from Pacifica Island Vanilla mist w/out the alcohol. In fact Pacifica mist is stronger. Save your money."

I heard reviews about being sugar cookie like. Where is the sugar cookie? I only smelled aggressive cheap florals with some sweetness and something that itches your nose if you smell intensively.

I am so delighted because I can no longer find that one anywhere and have been rationing my old bottle.This is such a simple, perfect vanilla fragrance.Cozy, somehow a little boozy, and very very sugary sweet, with a barely there airy violet. I almost did a U-turn in my car to go back and buy it when I kept smelling it in the air.A sugarplum fairy would wear this."

It’s a lightly floral, powdery, vanilla-y scent. Definitely smells like a soft sugar-coated violet, it’s not overly sweet though in my opinion. Very relaxing and calming. Much less overtly “summery” than most of the other SDJ body sprays - I think this will work any time of year. Also would be perfectly appropriate in an office/for work.For those who may know this comparison - this also bears a striking similarity to She Was an Anomaly by Etat Libre d’Orange (a soft iris perfume). This could be a more affordable alternative if you don’t have that one. They would also layer well together if you have both."

It does not smell ""juvenile"" at all and this is something you'd wear if you don't care about being notice. There's something so zen about this fragrance, to me.So this smells pretty but way too light for my liking and what I mean by light, I mean I could not smell it after 5 - 10 minutes on my SKIN at least ( and just like most fragrances, it is a no brainer that it'll last way longer on clothes ) . Every time I give it a chance, my thoughts are always the same ""would have been nice if you lasted a bit longer"" 😂 Every nose perceives things differently, so I'm surprised how others think this fragrance's sillage and longevity is good. 🤯"

I tried on my skin reminded him of celery, cigarettes, or air freshener. THIS body spray is the only fragrance that garnered an enthusiastic compliment, as smelling sweet, like a pretty woman.

I get most violet and vanilla from this in the opening. It dries down to a skin scent and I would say to my nose it leans a bit plum and blue raspberries too.It's not too sweet either.I would say for me it is the best so far from the brand. Also the first one I felt I really need to have in my collection of scents. A warm and cozy scent with blue tones for blue days, to make you feel happier. Too bad it don't linger that long, you have to respray it along the day."

Violet is also just about one of the only florals I can tolerate (I love Guerlain Insolence EDT).This is my new favourite Sol de Janeiro scent by FAR!! Sugared vanilla violets with a hint of sexiness. The purple colour is really fitting for this fragrance. It's inoffensive, would be good for layering but is great on its own. It seems pretty strong and lasts a long time. It's replacing '71 for me."

She's the type of vanilla you can wear any season. I want to find the perfume version of this. I'm still debating if I should get the full size of the mist or the butter. The body butter is divine and is an actual THICK body butter. I LOVE it. I feel like the mist has a very strong alcohol synthetic opening to it."

It reminds me of a vanilla cupcake. It evolves into a creamy, familiar scent that makes me slightly hungry. This lasts a decent time on me, I usually reapply every 4 hours or so. I like to spray a bit on my hair and it lasts overnight and makes my pillow smell scrumptious.It's sweet and the sugar really comes through but it's not overwhelmingly sweet to me. I personally don't get much floral note out of this, mostly the vanilla, sandalwood, and the plum.Bottom line, i'm obsessed with this and look forward to wearing it every day."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I really like the body products from this company and I got the lotion when it was released. It’s has a thicker, more buttery consistency than their bum bum cream, or the beija flor ones. It’s wonderfully moisturizing and the light scent lasts forever. I ended up buying the matching body spray because I like the lotion enough to use it often, and its scent is strong enough to compete with other perfumes. The body spray performs like a body spray- so I’d recommend throwing it in your purse and just plan to reapply a few times a day. The scent is EXTREMELY familiar to me but I can’t quite place it. (It does not smell like B&BW Twilght Woods to me) No notes stand out to me- it’s not overly vanilla forward, and I don’t get any sandalwood either. I think the effect just evokes clean skin. It smells sweet, but not sugary, light, clean, inoffensive. I can’t imagine it bothering anyone, so it would be a safe bet for the office."

The longevity isn’t as long but it’s also a body mist and when taking that into account I’d say it’s actually pretty good. The matching body butter is also really nice and super moisturizing—probably their best formula yet. I think when combined the scent projects nicely, but individually it’s a little more than a skin scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The scent is light, especially for something from this brand, but that’s what I enjoy about it. A light, not-too-sweet powdery vanilla. To my nose, this does not smell like cupcakes, frosting or cookies - as other reviewers have said. It’s warm, a bit creamy and quite cozy. There’s something fresh and clean about it but they’ve managed to do it with vanilla. Smells like an addictive spa lotion and I feel like I’ll reach for it year round. Paired with the body butter, this one actually smells expensive on me and definitely not juvenile in the slightest.Out of all of their offerings, this is my favorite and easiest reach besides the original. It’s simple and feels fresh. I can’t remember the last time I wore a body spray, but here we are. I like it and enjoy mixing it with many perfumes.Despite the fact that this is less of a powerhouse than their other fragrances (in terms of projection), it lasts and lasts on my skin. It’s simply a softer fragrance. Overall - subtle and beautiful."

ALL the rest. Just me? IDK. But I'm disappointed and it's getting returned."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I had mixed feelings about buying because of the notes and reviews, but since I liked the other sprays by SDJ I gave in and I have to say I could have lived without it. First, longevity is miserable, much weaker than with the other sprays, sillage is not big either. The scent is not bad but not great either. I get all the notes, but they are kinda flat. The opening is very alcoholic, after a few minutes I get the flowery component and then it settles down to a warm sweetness, which is nice but really nothing special. I was expecting more, since the other sprays are more interesting and complex, and stay around a bit longer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sol-de-Janeiro/Cheirosa-59-88722.html,Cheirosa &amp;#039;59 Sol de Janeiro perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I’ve been searching for my new layering scent and this is it, my favorite scent from Sol de Janeiro. I was never a gourmand person so never thought to give this brand a chance, but the scent notes on this one piqued my interest. It’s beautiful! On me, it starts off a little sweet, which I usually avoid. However, it’s not sickeningly sweet-it’s very nice, and the other notes control the sweetness so it’s not overwhelming or cloying. Once it dries down it’s a beautifully warm woody vanilla scent with a touch of orchid. The scent is not “too” warm that I would avoid wearing it during spring/summer. Matter of fact, it’s lighter than other fragrances in my collection, so it’s a lovely everyday scent for any time of year. On the other hand, it’s a calming and relaxing scent at night. Just a perfect fragrance for me all around.Forgot to mention, my husband also loved this scent and could smell it from the other end of the room! Truly captivating."

When it comes to Sol de Janeiro, I really like their scents but only really fell in love with Cheirosa 40. This has a similar vibe to 40 for me. If Cheirosa 40 smells of powdered vanilla sugar (which it does to me), this one is the creamy frosting on top of a cupcake. It's very warm and creamy and reminds me at times of shea butter. Yet there is a powdery note to it, especially after it dries down which reminds me of soap when I catch a whiff of it in the air. For people who like violet candies this is for you!The only downside to this is that it has VERY intimate sillage and on my skin, it doesn't last very long. Usually after 2 hours I don't pick up on it anymore. But I don't mind it, I use it more often if I'm having a day where I'm just chilling at home or running errands."

I did buy After Hours which got the ""old lady"" monicor here by fragrance lovers that I assume are much younger than I am. I will say to them all wait, one day you will turn around and be old yourself. It comes for us all if we are lucky enough to stay alive. With that being said I like 59. I get vanilla orchid mostly. A very sweet one but not gourmand. A lot of musk in the base and a mild woodiness from a synthetic sandalwood. I would actually wear this. It reminds me of Precious Liquid vanilla orchid but without the dried fruit/date note. Also less intense than that one was. This is much lighter and actually more wearable for everyday. This also reminds me of Vancleef & arpels orchidee vanille because of the sugared violets. No chocolate though. If you are on a budget and can't afford those other 2 higher prices fragrances I mentioned this is a nice affordable option."

I bought myself the full bottle and was so disappointed with the scent, the powderiness is horrible and smells kinda like the bottle melted into the perfume. i hate the opening of ariana cloud(especially the mist because i feel like that one smells more synthetic than the perfume) but this is just not for me, maybe i will edit this when the vanilla macerates for a little bit because for now this is a no from me, most of the unpleasant scent comes off a bit in the first hour or two but it still can smell a touch of it i don’t think i would be able to wear this even with the okay drydown."

They are not exactly 1:1 but so similar that I cannot justify keeping both. For what it's worth, Cheirosa 59 begins quite floral and candy-sweet, but has a lovely powdery violet accord that settles down to a creamy sandalwood and vanilla scent. Personally I prefer Bare over this for lasting power and projection, as Cheirosa 59 doesn't project much off the skin or clothes after about an hour. Bare is also less cloying, smoother, and slightly more mature to my nose. If you want that sugary frosting vibe, Cheirosa 59 will be up your alley. If you want a powdery woody violet vanilla that isn't cloying, go for Bare."

I get very little vanilla, just some sweet flowers and then it very quickly turns into a powdery skin scent.

I like the powderiness of the violet and the sandalwood but the vanilla and sugar don't seem to work well in this fragrance. I like sweet notes but to me this is cloying, juvenile and smells like it's having an identity crisis: it doesn't know if it wants to be a delicate powdery floral or a pink sugar-esque sugar bomb aimed at kids.

I also get a tacky similar note to KP Royal Revolution, overall so disappointing and I’m not sure why they’ve released this when they have a similar scent, and discontinue one of the most requested scents"

At first, I did not like it. I thought it was an overwhelming creamy yet floral powdery scent. After a bit, I realized it was the shea and coconut butters projecting too much. Once I let it settle, those scents dissipated and I was left with a lighter fragrance.The scent is a powdery floral, vanilla scent mainly. It's sweet but not overwhelmingly so; the sweetness balances out the powder well. This creates a marshmallow effect. In addition, I get a dry woods in the base. The website lists vetiver which would explain this. It's nice, especially for layering or days where you don't want something too complex or strong.Overall, it's nice and inoffensive but very generic smelling. I think the closest thing I could compare it to is Bath & Body Works Beach Nights but softer and less complex. I'd prefer Beach Nights because it's a bit more gourmand."

When I arrived at my destination, I realized I left my fragrance bag at home, so I have been wearing this for the past week daily, and it is a major compliment magnet! To my nose, the powdery sweetness fades relatively quickly, and it settles into a lovely scent bubble of vanilla, sandalwood, and subtle musk. After about five hours, I cannot smell this on myself, but I have received compliments on my scent seven to eight hours into wearing this body mist!!!! It is a solid choice for cooler weather and daytime or evening occasions when you want something sweet yet sophisticated."

I can’t tell if majority of them are bots, paid employees trying to sabotage their competitors or what. All I can say is that some of the opinions and comparisons I read on certain fragrances are absolutely wild. Like, utterly made up sounding. Idk man…I guess it’s not that deep, but whenever the people in my fb fragrance groups want to have a good laugh, we screenshot the weirdest reviews and share it amongst each other.Anyway, this is an absolutely lovely fragrance. It smells like vanilla frosting, candied violets and a bit oriental. Probably from the sheer sandalwood. It’s got a nice, creamy touch and I personally don’t find it to be overly gourmand, but still sweet. Longevity is okay for a body mist. Lasts much longer on clothes for sure. Easy reach. Super cozy. Nothing too groundbreaking, but I still love it 9/10 🪻"

However, since lapsang souchang is a main note, I had to try it. Lapsang souchange tea is a favorite of mine and is distinctive because it's smoked over pine wood but there's not even a hint of smoke in it. It's mainly just a sweet citrusy tea with pear and a hint of white flowers. At first, I didn't think it was a winner for me, but I liked it enough to refresh it all day long (it only lasts maybe 3-4 hours). The pear note makes it addictive. I feel like it could use a little cardamom or something to perk it up, but it's still really nice."

Takes me about 12 to 14 sprays to achieve a moderate silage that will last about 4 hours until it becomes a skin scent for a few more hours. The smokiness from the tea fights with the jasmine in the opening. I love this but can see how others might pick up on a sour note for a short time. Once the vanilla kicks in though...wow, it is a dreamy, warm and creamy delight with just the right amount of sweetness. Just ordered another bottle. I sure hope that they won't stop making this one.I have since noticed that I can wear a little less of this perfume if I change up my fragrance daily. The nose- blindness is real."

It’s nice, though, and definitely a winner if the earthy, bitter notes aren’t a turn-off for you. Personally, it’s not a necessity because I already have a jasmine tea fragrance in Gucci Premiere EdT, and I’d probably be happy enough layering it with one of the 146782 vanillas in my wardrobe to get a similar effect.In terms of performance, it’s more of an intimate one with close throw; on the poor side of longevity."

To me they are cousins. They have different different opening where the Bvlgari creation is more citrusy and bright while this is more vanilla-sweet, but their drydown is similar, only Bvlgari to me has more depth. I think for the young at heart this is a great jasmine-tea fragrance, somewhere after the opening it becomes a little too sour on my skin, but the drydown is creamy and simply divine. I am not a fan of the OG Born in Roma smelling like a celeb fragrance to me, I prefer BBW's Pink Obsessed instead which combines some more elements reminiscent of JPG La Belle and Police To Be Goodvibes.

The reviews are wild on this one.And so is mine. Cause upon first spray Britney's Midnight Fantasy comes to my mind?!First I defo get berries, lots of sour lime, sugar and some smokey woodsy notes.After 10mins there's blueberry/raspberry/mint bubblegum.After 1-2h I get a jasmine/detergent smell.After 2h some vanilla comes through and it starts to reminds me more of DBIR, which I like.Overall I don't hate it, it's just redundant imo."

So many people talked about it being this lovely unique vanilla tea scent with an added green twist (including some lime), but I didn't get that at all on my skin.The opening was all jasmine, then in the drydown it's a softer jasmine with a slight green scent that's kind of minty. That must be the tea, because I looked up lapsang souchong and apparently it has a smoky pine needle scent. I wouldn't describe it like that, more like someone who smokes but takes a lot of breath mints.Definitely not what I expected though! Certainly no vanilla and this stuff is super, super weak. I sprayed it on less than an hour ago and it's almost completely gone! This one is a huge fail for me. The scent itself is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It just feels empty and weak, smelling of almost nothing. Definitely not the ""perfumey"" scent some people claim it to be.Honestly I think this needed more notes. A green tea note would have worked, and maybe some bergamot or something to liven it up. It just feels so flat. I'm also not getting the lime note everyone is talking about, and it's not in the listed notes or product description.I actually double checked to make sure I was spraying the right bottle and I definitely was, yet I read these reviews and I can't help but think, ""Are we smelling the same perfume???""Overall... save your money."

I tested it, loved it, and made myself leave the store without buying it. I went home and laid in bed with the paper I sprayed it on. I could think of nothing else but this fragrance. I went back to Ulta and bought the largest size right before they closed. What a f'ing loser I am! But if you're on this site, chances are, you understand!Also, for me this lasts pretty well.

I was searching for a fresh vanilla and this is THE fresh vanilla scent that I’ve been searching for, the tea and lime notes in this perfume are amazingly beautiful. I’m not sure about the longevity of this yet, but it can be whatever, the scent makes up for it. It’s feminine but it has some unisex vibe for it which I love. Such a beautiful perfume. My little sister hates every perfume I own, because she has migraines, but she is in love with this one also."

It's too sweet for my liking, I've never been a fan of vanillas taking the main stage like this so it's almost sickly to me. There's an indiscernible floral note that doesn't smell like jasmine but more like a vague white flower. The tea is practically non-existent, which is the most disappointing thing for me.Overall, not bad, but not what I was hoping it to be."

I fell in love with this. I bought a travel size bottle, and it is nearly empty. This is a spring flanker, so limited edition, which means I will be getting the largedt bottle available very soon.I wear a couple of sorays per day: one on my chest, making sure my clothes will smell all day, and they do; and one in my hair, which lasts most of the day. I like wearing it to bed too, which I cannot say of many fragrances.This is not masculine, and I am not sure how anyone can say that it is. I love the tea in it, I always live jasmibe, and I find the vanilla rounds up the scent harmony perfectly. In spite of the vanilla, tgis is not a gourmand scent. It us a refreshing, spring-summer adult scent with no sweetness. It has been a long time since a fragrance has made such a positive impression on me. I usually prefer spicy, exotic scents, so it is a departure for me, but such a nice surprise!"

I've got washing tablets of lavender and camomile that last for 4 days on clothes...I felt very sad after rush-purchasing this and thankfully my bottle is tiny. There's nothing worth respraying for, nothing special or beautiful, there's no magic at all, theres not even a pretty skin scent or faint ghost of beauty.My body spray from Impulse, Festival Fields, is more green and sparkling than this, quite frankly, as a perfumer lover, I feel genuinely ripped off and I rarely ever have anything negative to say regarding perfume, for me, this is like buying a luxury car made of holograms with no engine... and this is coming from the only fan of Christian Dior Millie Au Foret - which is quietly stratospheric.If you want the feeling that this is trying to sell, please find excellence here - some are sadly discontinued but were above and beyond fabulous green/sparkling/herby feminine fragrances that truly have fragrance:Escada Sport for womenFrédéric Malle Synthetic Nature Eau de ParfumBalenciaga - RosabotanicaLancome O - more sparkling citrusChanel Chance eau FraicheTom Ford LimesElizabeth Arden Green Tea any versionFRESH Polianthes TurberosaGuerlain Allegoria rangeBody Shop - English Rose (very fresh tea rose)"

The vanilla & jasmine are sweet & feminine, a masculine man couldn’t pull this off. I’m not really into fresh fragrances, they usually bore me and the longevity is always short. I love the Born in Roma lineup and I’m bored of Alien Goddess by Mugler, which is my go to summertime scent, so I tried this one on my skin at Sephora and I was blown away. It’s so simple but so beautiful. The tea note in the opening is fresh and sparkly, and it lingers throughout the entire wear without fading into the bottom notes. The jasmine is prominent but it’s not as heavy as the intense version, the vanilla is sweet but it’s not as sugary as the original. As for longevity, I threw on a few sprays before work and I could smell it on myself for a few hours before I went nose blind. The vanilla will macerate over time and the performance will improve, the Born in Roma lineup are known for their performances and longevity. It’s a crowd pleasing scent but I wouldn’t consider it a man magnet like the original, I think more women will compliment it. Overall, I’m glad I added a tea centered fragrance to my collection and I highly recommend it for summer."

On my body the only difference i can tell between the two is that gold rush leans slightly more mature but it fills a room better.I would definitely vote this as a safe buy! Great for summer spring and cooler days but maybe not winter. It would be perfect for a rainy day and it’s definitely office safe.A safe clean office scent. No harm done here!

The OG smells weird and metallic on my skin so I'm actually not fond of it, even though it smells good on other people. I'm more into Green Stravaganza, Yellow Dream and the Intense DBIR.Green Stravaganza smells like matcha tea with a super lactonic marshmallow-y base for me. It's absolutely delicious but light at the same time. It has a great balance of fresh and sweet. Yellow Dream is kinda the same formula. I think the people working on this line of scents really know how to balance fresh and sweet. They're so sweet I still feel like they're slightly gourmand. Green Stravaganza like having a fresh herbal tea with lots of sugar and milk. Or having a matcha tea with a whipped cream cake.I may be a minority here because I haven't seen many people saying it's lactonic and creamy. I guess I just got lucky that I pick up on it. It smells amazing. The sillage and longevity are okay. I feel like this scent is meant to be more quiet and calming. I wouldn't mind if they amped it up a bit more and made it a bit more bold. However I still think it's lovely. I would love to have a big bottle but 165 is a bit much for me. Gotta stick to the travel sprays for now😭"

Such a beautiful green tea and jasmine scent. Perfect for Mother’s Day and for the rest of summer. Beautiful light and floral at the same time. this strays away from the OG In a small way the is green and fresh! Perfect for humid summer nightsI am so happy I tried this and got this in my collection. As of this time I can’t tell if longevity and sillage will be good. Will report on later! I think everyone can wear this not too feminie or masculine!

It's such a refreshing take on the original BIR! Its vanilla and jasmine, but done in such a classy, elegant way! The tea note isn't cheap or generic. I think this is a beautifully blended perfume, and I will be honest - I have an aversion to BIR perfume because the bottles remind me of my high school tumblr era days. It just looks a little tacky. After spraying the tester in store, I kept sniffing my wrist where I sprayed it. I went back the next day and bought the travel size. I finished the travel size in a week and a half, and purchased a bottle. It smells so good. It is honestly an inoffensive fragrance that is a bit different from all the cloying gourmands that are saturating the market right now.I wish this lasted longer, but you can always spray on clothes to increase longevity. Most of us go nose blind, and it probably lasts longer on skin than we know. I highly recommend this flanker. I hope it sticks around forever."

The Valentino website states that the vanilla base note is cool and I definitely pick up on that. I do sense some tart and green notes, especially in the beginning, but this is nowhere near as tart as say.. Burberry Her (which I love). Green Stravaganza stays pleasant throughout even though there are no remarkable changes. On clothes I can still smell it the next day. I love a fresh perfume that actually sticks around. Others have said they can’t pick out the particular notes, it just smells like perfume-and I kind of agree, but somehow I still really like it. Maybe because the freshness is keeping it a bit different from the other jasmine amber types. I honestly wouldn’t even say this is an amber floral due to it being fresh and light. Anyway- I like it."

Smells so fresh with only a little bit of sweetness. It's creamy white floral with vanilla. Honestly, I really tried to detect that Lapsang Souchong tea note but there was absolutely none. Still, it was very nice, bright, fresh, and absolutely beautiful.I looked forward to this coming to my store mainly due to that smoked tea note. But there was none, or it could be just plain, green tea. I drink Lapsang Souchong tea at home so I AM familiar with its scent. Do NOT blind buy if you're hoping for that smoked tea. Otherwise, it's definitely blind buy safe."

I happened to pick this up and sniff it because it was nearby in my Sephora/Kohl's and I was rapidly picking up bottles to sniff them. This was one of the only 2 that compelled me to spray a test strip. I've been a hater of this line since the OG Donna, which everyone was always ranting and raving about and I just couldn't see the hype. Then when Born In Roma came out I thought it'd be more of the same and tested it one day, only to find out I thought it was even worse. A sugary simplistic mess of a fragrance that- to me- smells like it could've came out of Bath & Body Works main catalogue. (this was back in that make everything smell like Flowerbomb/Pink Sugar era, I'll admit they've stepped up their game in recent years). When I picked this up to smell it, and even after spraying it and letting it dry down a bit I also believed that this contained a pear note. I see that bergamots are used in the advertising picture, and although I don't know much about the tea mentioned I don't really smell the notes that are listed. I get a nondescript fruity floral with a drydown of sweetness, which I know I'm not making sound great, but this still managed to impress me. I said ""wow!"" when I smelled this and as we walked out the door and my sinuses opened up more to enjoy the scent it began to bloom and become more complex. I think this fragrance is very well blended, and more complex than they're letting on. This might become an underrated release from the line, and if the other flankers are this much removed from the original I'd like to try them next. Getting high praise from my husband in the fragrance department almost NEVER happens, and he expressed that he liked this one, so I know I'll be purchasing a bottle at some point. I may go back for a travel spray in the next week or so. Happily surprised by this one."

It’s light and fresh, with the brightness of the tea. I think the vanilla grounds it keeping it from being too sharp. While it’s not complex it’s enjoyable and would work well in the heat. I really seem to enjoy Donna’s flankers more than the OG. I get a hint of OG DNA but not much. I honestly think they could have make this its own scent but they wanted to ride on the popularity of the Donna Born in Roma line."

I really like the balmy, deep sweetness of the original BIR. With this I think they attempted to keep that at the heart of the fragrance, while adding an herbal tea note, and the composition can't figure out if it wants to be bright and zesty, or deep and sensual. It just isn't quite right on me."

To me this smells nothing like the notes / accords. I could have sworn this had pear in it; there's a fresh fruitiness in the opening. It dries down to a silky vanilla. Maybe Valentino did this intentionally - the Uomo also smells nothing like coffee to me. Of the two, I much prefer the Donna take."

However, it does smell like color of the bottle, so I enjoy it. Yet, unlike Yellow Dream, it isn't a spikey perfume at all, it's much smoother and so it's texture doesn't match the bottle. I do wish the tea was turned up more, maybe it would feel a little edgier.Everything is really nice, and as this dries it becomes very much more vanillic, but it's lacking depth and intrigue.It was nice to test this because I was curious, but it's an easy pass for me."

It's a little too sweet for me in the beginning, I would have liked something else instead of vanilla in the base. The tea is subtle, but it is very much there, not a dark Earl Grey tea, but much fresher, like Lady Grey! As it dries, the sweetness mellows, and the floral/tea, slightly powdery mix is just exquisite! It is perfect for the spring and early fall, but will probably be too heavy for the summer."

I tested DBIR Green in a Sephora and was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's absolutely a tea scent and absolutely not EA Green Tea. There's no citrus here and no ultra sharp green tea zing. It warms down into this cozy, creamy vanilla base that somehow still maintains an airy spring feeling. There is jasmine, but it's soft and not at all indolic. The vanilla ties the tea and the jasmine together to create a fragrance that feels more like a green vanillic aromatic and keeps it out of the aggressive white floral category. In fact, I'm surprised to see ""white floral"" leading the main accords. For my nose and my skin, this is a love. I got compliments on my first errand after testing. She's not loud, but lovely and has moderate sillage and staying power."

I get mostly tea and some vanilla. The jasmine is also well done in this. This scent is a sweet freshie not really floral. Spring time and fall time perfect. Not too sure how this would do in heat, might be too cloying. This is the best flanker in my opinion next to the original. Not gonna like, I was not interested in this scent at all, the green color threw me off, but I sampled it Sephora and I fell in love. Overall performance is similar to the original as well, 10/10.

I don’t get any tea vibes, more so a bit of tart fruit, followed by strong white florals, and the signature DBIR vanilla (which for whatever reason turns extremely powdery in this perfume)."

I love tea fragrances. To my nose, it smells like a sweet jasmine green tea. It's long lasting and other people will be able to smell it on you. I purchased a full size!

Having said that, this is among the most disappointing perfumes I have smelled in a very long time. I could not detect ANY tea whatsoever, just an incredibly generic, sweet, slightly green smell.

Not going to scrub though, I want to see if it develops.Edit 2: My partner said the whole room smelled like an airport/ hotel lobby when coming home, and I couldn't agree more.

It has a really beautiful sweetness from the vanilla that I love. It isn't a straight up vanilla though, it's more of a candy sweetness mixed with the Jasmine that I get. I also don't know how much of a ""tea"" fragrance this is, because maybe I just don't know what Lapsong Souchang smells like. I think the tea adds a slight aromatic greenness to it. I also definitely do get the original DBIR DNA swirling around in the background. Overall I just really like this flanker the best. Coral Fantasy was just alright, it was a bit juvenile smelling to me, but this is just beautiful! So glad to have it!"

My grandma smiled when I showed her this & said it smelled like caramelo. My aunt also said “ooooooh I realllyyyy like it”. The opening is quite aromatic & herbal-green. I’m surprised they aren’t listed as accords because it reminds me of a freshly brewed cup of tea. I don’t find it sweet at all; it is more of a green jasmine with light sugar touches, but then the base notes resemble the original Donna Born in Roma. However Green Stravaganza is more of an airy vanilla. I don’t think the longevity is the best though :( the travel spray will be good for touch ups but I’m already halfway through it."

I wasn't sure I liked it at 1st, but I found myself continuing to smell the hand I sprayed it on...which for me if I keep going back for more means I am def intrigued by it. Someone had mentioned it would do better in warmer weather....today it was about 70 degrees with a light wind...when I left the store and was walking outside, the wind blew the scent from my hand up in the air, and it was the most pleasant, uplifting scent with a touch of sweetness. It's completely unique to the other flankers, but in the dry down I can smell a bit of the original DNA. By the time I got home I went ahead and got online and purchased a full bottle.If you are curious about it, Macy's will give you a free sample you can take home with you.I def see this as a Spring/Summer day scent...good for running errands, office, hanging out with friends...just a nice casual, yet uplifting scent.

Probably not to help I have a bit of a blocked nose, but everyone around me said it smelled lovely. A fresh, bright scent definitely. Instantly it smells very green, and I didn’t really get the green tea hit. It smelt more like cut grass with lime almost, but it was lovely nonetheless. It is definitely a favourite, and I think I might have to buy a full size! It doesn’t last very long unfortunately, but it’s pleasant to begin with. It’s a bright, green, citrusy fresh fragrance. Love it. It reminds me of the Lipton Green Tea, the bottle of it. A fresh sweet iced green tea, is the best way to describe it."

This is sweet, powdery and the tea smells realistic in an overly sweet way (think sweet iced green tea) and the dry down has an overall “perfumey” quality. I will say the vanilla in this is quite synthetic to me and maybe even a bit too sweet but I enjoy this from time to time and will definitely pick this up during springtime"

As its drying down on my skin it kinda takes on a weird middle ground where the jasmine and citrus-like green tea seem to fight eachother, rather than harmonize.After a while of drying down I do get that floral powdery DBIR-esque vibe after the tea fades, but it's very faint. This is by no means a miss for me, but I feel like the tea/jasmine notes are competing, and you don't get the lovely vanilla/DBIR until much later. Green Stravaganza doesn't wear as long as Yellow Dream does on me which...may be a good thing.Its quiet and not offensive but still very green and not at all like the other DBIR flankers and original. Not a safe blind buy at all except for those of us who are simply collecting the series as they come. Purchased from: Sephora"

Love the cleaner qualities of Yellow Dream and Coral Fantasy from the Born in Roma line, and this Green Stravaganza follows suit but in a completely unique direction. Beautiful bright vanillic tea that is simply gorgeous and doesn’t take itself too seriously, Im truly impressed with this fragrance, especially much more so than the men’s Green Stravaganza. Such an amazing herbal quality from the tea that has a very pleasant and happy quality about it, interestingly not really smoky at all given this kind of tea should be more smoky but it’s incredibly easy on the nose and wearable. Already a big fan of the Born in Roma line for women and this is a great addition to it that brings something new and fun to the table."

This is not green at all! No grassy or leafy notes. It's a sweet, little bit fruity fragrance. I swear there is kiwi or some sort of melon in here? The tea note is not dominant. It's like tea if you added a ton of sugar to it. A hint of sweet spearmint, I think. No smokiness. No woody notes. It's a sweet, fresh, pleasant scent that is perfect for spring. If you like Coral Fantasy, as I do, I think you will also like this. Also, it is not a huge room-filler---it's more subtle. Agewise- I think any age group would enjoy it, all the way down to teenagers. It has a youthful vibe."

I have to say it wowed me. I read the notes and knew I was interested because I love a good tea scent, but I was surprised at how instantly hooked I was! I ordered a full sized bottle immediately.Prior to its release, I don’t remember the mention of vanilla being in this (another fav note of mine) but the blend is absolutely gorgeous. Despite the packaging & color of the juice/box itself - this isn’t grassy or sharply green. Reading through the reviews here, I must say I detect no lime or mint in this, either. I think the power of suggestion may be at play here due to its color & overall freshness being associated with those notes.It’s a beautiful blend of delicate sweet tea and the kind of vanilla that is found in Burberry Goddess. I’m a big fan of Jo Malone’s Earl Grey & Cucumber fragrance, but find it a teeny bit sharp before it dries down. This, on the other hand, is smoother and remains beautiful from first spray to the dry down and eventual fade.I also like that the tea isn’t „smoky”. I’ve seen some complaints about that, but there are so many smoky fragrances on the market (smoky cherry, smoky woods, tobacco, etc) that this is a refreshing change. I’ve been a tea drinker my entire life and smokiness just doesn’t come to mind when I think of tea. I know the scent description on the Valentino website promises a smokiness, but I’m so glad it isn’t really present.It’s calming with the perfect amount of feminine sweetness and effortless freshness. I quite like the original as well, but this is truly something different. I can see myself reaching for this constantly. Fresh, bright, clean, slightly creamy… this just melts into the skin in the best way possible. Just gorgeous and, dare I say, signature worthy.If you’re obsessed with tea scents and looking for something uplifting, delicate, feminine and sweet - this is the one."

The tea note was strongest in the opening and then took a backseat to more fruity and floral notes in the drydown. Can’t say I was a fan of the drydown either. I agree with another reviewer that it became a generic fruity-floral. The sweet DNA from the original Donna Born in Roma is definitely in there, but it is an almost candy artificial sweet in this flanker and I am not a fan."

This opens MOUTHWATERINGLY juicy and fresh. There's absolutely more to the ingredients list than what Valentino is letting on...As is typical of a flanker, this smells similar to the original DBIR, but that doesn't become apparent until the dry down. In the opening it's a blast of fresh, juicy citrus (I know marketing, the colour/design of the bottle and so forth can affect our experience but I SWEAR I smell lime!), but there's also a watery vibe that will make this a smash hit when the weather starts warming up again! This phase only lasts about 30 minutes tops which makes me sad as it's my favourite part, but I do enjoy the dry down too:After the citruses run their course, jasmine ushers in to take centre stage, tea playing a supporting role. The jasmine doesn't become insufferable like in Mugler Alien or Angel, thankfully, but it's still fairly strong. I could detect the tea note which somewhat reminded me of jasmine tea (no shit) but also matcha ever so slightly. Soon after that familiar cashmerean note found in the original DBIR begins to creep in, which is when its similarity to the original comes to light.Essentially Green Stravaganza dries down to the original DBIR but with a MUCH strong hit of jasmine. Definitely need to go back and test it again, but I wouldn't be surprised if I end up owning both this & the original!"

V v & I mean VERY tiny hint of mebbe stale fag ash. Also there is a hint of plastic which I just loathe. Only one in-store test. Will come back to it later.. Dry down I think has a hint of coconut n is partly why we've ended up with such an eclectic line-up of 'reminds mes'.Forgot to mention, this here ladies version is £67 for 30ml. The lads one, the uomo, is also £67. FOR 50ML. So this one got the pink tax, for some reason. Mens version is basic but way better than this n lasts longer btw. Ps. Doesn't even last on clothes n the blotter in my pocket is smelless. Normally I'm left with something! 🫤"

It’s very different from what I expected…I was hoping for something more green and extravagant. It doesn’t mean it’s not pretty, just bit too shy and soft. The lapsang note is not smokey enough, jasmine isn’t indolic enough and vanilla is just sweet and creamy. It reminds me of Milky jasmine tea drink from bubble tea bar, which’s not anything bad just far away from what I was longing. Main problem is longevity and sillage, it simply doesn’t exist after one hour. Anyway if there would be dirtier intense version, I would love it."

Although fruity, not as fruity as the OG, and I consider that a good thing.I like all flankers in the series, apart from the original. To me the notes clash in an unpleasant way in the OG, not so here.I love lapsang souchong tea, and as someone else mentioned it’s a smoky (smoked) black tea. I’m not getting any of that here. There is however a slightly smoky-woody-ambroxany note, similar to that in the original, but not as pronounced. The white floral might be working as a bridge between the herbalness and the vanilla, but I can’t really identify the floral note.I like it so far, but will need to wear more. Also, it might need more heat to shine (I’m writing this in January in the north of Sweden - not so much heat).Edit: It just occurred to me, it reminds me of YSL Black Opium Floral Shock, but without the coffee note. Or I’m just delirious because of the never ending winter. 🤷♀️😂(Edit: I always write reviews based on skin test.)"

I absolutely love it! I haven't even smelled Green Tea in 15 years (it was my mom's signature scent until JLo Glow grabbed that spot) so I have fond memories of the scent. I can't believe this smells like Green Tea just sweeter. So it has the refreshing vibe of Green Tea but also starts off with this unique sweetness and dries down powdery. It lasts 6 plus hours. Projection is medium. I've never smelled Valentino Donna Rosa Verde but it's interesting it's voted as most similar to Green Stravaganza and it also has EA Green Tea as the most similar perfume.

Very work approriate, very ""clean girl"". The perfect discreet scent.Personally, I expected more vanilla, but there's very little. Unfortunately I'm not very familiar with different tea blends, so cannot comment on the lifelikeness of this perfume to a cup of lapsang souchong.Would recommend to those who work in healthcare or other workplaces where strong scents are a definite nono.Maybe this will bloom in warmer climate?The green colour of the juice is nice, compliments the fragrance and makes the box stand out from others in the line as well as other perfume brands.For reference my favourite Donna Born in Roma is the Coral one."

Anywho, I plan on trying this be will come back and update with an actual review!🥀Update 04/30 - Tried it at Ulta a few days ago. Although not a bad fragrance by any means. And I like designer fragrances, I’m not a niche snob (as I don’t have the money for that). So I really was hoping for something more, but I found it a little generic and not special. This is just my opinion. I also only tried on paper as I didn’t want to mess up my already fragranced (Chanel) body. I do think many will like this, so go try it! But I will say if you like fresh and green scents, this didn’t come off as one to me. The vanilla is too prominent imo to be fresh, and I saw a comment comparing to Elizabeth Arden’s Green Tea and I couldn’t disagree more. I love EA Green Tea, and this is not that. These are all my own opinions, try for yourself! 🙂"

This is not green at all! No grassy or leafy notes. It's a sweet, little bit fruity fragrance. I swear there is kiwi or some sort of melon in here? The tea note is not dominant. It's like tea if you added a ton of sugar to it. A hint of sweet spearmint, I think. No smokiness. No woody notes. It's a sweet, fresh, pleasant scent that is perfect for spring. If you like Coral Fantasy, as I do, I think you will also like this. Also, it is not a huge room-filler---it's more subtle. Agewise- I think any age group would enjoy it, all the way down to teenagers. It has a youthful vibe."

I tested DBIR Green in a Sephora and was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's absolutely a tea scent and absolutely not EA Green Tea. There's no citrus here and no ultra sharp green tea zing. It warms down into this cozy, creamy vanilla base that somehow still maintains an airy spring feeling. There is jasmine, but it's soft and not at all indolic. The vanilla ties the tea and the jasmine together to create a fragrance that feels more like a green vanillic aromatic and keeps it out of the aggressive white floral category. In fact, I'm surprised to see ""white floral"" leading the main accords. For my nose and my skin, this is a love. I got compliments on my first errand after testing. She's not loud, but lovely and has moderate sillage and staying power."

The mango makes it special, though, as it’s quite prominent and pretty realistic, although a little too funky and sour for my liking. It’s reminiscent of the original Flowerbomb with some of that juicy patchouli in the cloud, and the skin scent (after many hours, long after the scent has faded) reminds me of the original’s drydown.Average-not great on longevity and throw.It’s fine, but really, there’s just so many of these out right now. If you’ve smelled Alien Goddess or Beach Walk or Coconut Sun, you might as well say that you’ve smelled this one, too. But, if you love those fragrances, I can almost guarantee you’ll enjoy this one. (Quick note on the comparison to Fame: Yes, they’re both mango fragrances, but Fame has an odd laundry note that throws it off. The mango is louder and more realistic here .. If you’re wanting a mango fragrance and don’t mind some supporting beachy florals, I recommend Tiger Lily.)"

I don't feel like it's cheap at all, is it very juvenile? yes!I'd love to get a full size bottle still!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,It’s okay. A fruity floral that is best for summer. The coconut milk and mango stand out here. But it doesn’t evolve more than that. Like most from this brand it has moderate sillage and weak longevity.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Perfect summer scent! Coconut and mango are well balanced.

Ididnt know the notes before hand but when I smelt it I immediately thought this is perfect for a vacation.

It's a very lovely tropical scent. The coconut note is sweet, that's why I love this. I find this suitable for summers."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Folks who enjoy the sunscreen vibe may like this. I tried this from the tester in Sephora. My initial impression was, oh nice, very fresh fruit, coconut and tropical flowers with a nice spiciness from what is likely the tiger lily. Those attributes are fleeting though. It dries down quickly to mostly sunscreen with a hint of melon underneath, with no real sense of coconut remaining - which is not a deal breaker for me. I don't find a resemblance to the Mugler fragrances mentioned, with perhaps the exception of Angel eau Croisiere, because of the mango. The Muglers seem to be smoother blends than the Tiger Lily - the vanilla in the base of Alien Goddess stands out and Alien eau Sublime is more about citrus and white flowers over vanilla, no vanilla in Tiger Lily, the only creaminess is from sunscreen-like lotion. I think this is more for seekers of a classy summer office friendly pseudo-tropical fragrance, instead of the hot girl at the beach resort rockin' Sol de Janeiro type scents."

All of the notes are overdone. The mango, the freesia and massive coconut all together here are just overpowering and obnoxious. Every time I smell this fragrance anywhere I get a headache. Tacky, gross, a typical blob scent that has no class and no direction, well except to be noticed but you will be noticed for all the wrong reasons. There is a plastic cheap candle smell here as well. A Petroleum hot mess of a scent.For me it is very close to Fame. I think mango in perfume may not be for me. It seems I dislike most of the mango fragrances I try."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Coconut and mango notes but not the synthetic type we’re used to smelling in summer themed fragrance and body products, they actually smell like real mango and coconut. It’s kind of like wearing a mango coconut smoothie. It’s a compliment getter, if not a particularly complex scent. Reminds me a little of the Sol de Janeiro Rio radiance fragrance but more sophisticated."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I have to confess, I find this fragrance more interesting to sniff and write about than interesting to test and wear. The opening to me was a strange coconut-mango-tiger lily affair. I was more than pleased that the memory of mango was but for a brief moment in the opening. Coconut stayed on, tiger lily proved to be the note all notes were built around, and freesia and benzoin added decided interest. Tropical, interesting, but an acquired taste. And that's all I have to say."

It's over all a nice, warm, solar, amber floral. After a few minutes it smells very similar to Sun Di Gioia."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I am really enjoying this one; it’s quite unique. It opens with a fresh, juicy mango. That only lasts about two hours, which is disappointing because it’s so lovely! It then shifts into white flowers and coconut. The coconut smell bothered me at first because it reminded me of the milk you get in a can but I’ve never worn a fragrance with coconut before so I had to get used to it. The salty coconut note also cuts down the sharp white flowers note and keeps them from turning into smelling like old lady White Diamonds and cigarettes lol. I feel like the more I wear it, the more I pick up on the nuances of the fragrance. It’s great if you live in a hot climate, like the desert SW. it keeps me pretty fresh. It lasts a decent amount of time, about 8 hours. I find if I spray it on my hair, the white flowers and coconut can last for over 24 hours, which is nice. It’s feminine, without being too girly, young without being immature, and it’s fresh, like you’re walking in a beach with mango trees nearby. I really love the breezy vibe it gives off! It’d be a great summer fragrance addition to your collection."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I really don’t like this, but I’m not a coconut fan. It’s too reminiscent of all of the other “beach” scents. It’s Beach Walk with a slightly tropical twist. I much rather wear Mambo (for women) by Liz Claiborne for under $20. I love Viktor & Rolph and it’s one of my two favorite designer houses, but I don’t think it would stand the test of time."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is my favorite Flowerbomb. Probably because it doesnt smell like the other flowerbombs. Idk it was just something about the scent that didnt sit well with me. I wanted to love them (OG, Dew, and Nectar). I was going to “settle” for dew as a clean scent but why settle in life?! Then this came out and its everything. I tried to layer it with Gritti Mango Aoud. Didnt like that combo but when I layered Tiger Lily with FENTY I couldnt stop spraying myself!! I tried this combo for the first time in 90+ degree weather. Went from brunch to happy hour and I felt I smelled amazing. I dont care if no one complimented me (people around me know I smell good so they dont say it much anymore). But this combo is sexy and sensual!! I have 10mls of both and I already put the 1oz of each in my sephora cart."

It actually reminds me of Olympea, mixed with alien goddess and a little bit of fame. It’s perfectly likeable, not something that I would typically wear, but it does smell good."

I read all the reviews that said it was such a long lasting fragrance and expected to be surrounded by this beautiful scent for hours. First I sprayed it and it was so strong so I ended up so confused when I couldn’t smell it on myself after an hour. Thinking about it though the original flowerbomb was the same on my skin. I’m so jealous of the people who find it to be long lasting, 😭"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I always have mixed feelings about tropical scents as they tend to be suitable only for seaside vacation in my opinion; or too synthetic, or too cloying, or too smoothie-like and not elegant enough. This one however, keeps all its tropical vibe in check - is both tropical and smooth, feminine, versatile, suitable also for cooler seasons. To my nose it is sweet and a bit cloying if over-sprayed, but not overpowering. I get mostly very natural smelling mango, just a hint of florals and a beautiful lactonic/coconut base. Coconut is not synthetic and does not dominate the composition, just creates a smooth, delicious background.It is what I call a quality designer fragrance. Don't expect too much creativity or uniqueness from it. The performance is more than OK on me - easily 6-8 hours with a moderate, lovely sillage just around me.Just out of my curiosity I layered it on some niche, masculine leaning, fragrances and it is like a smooth, calming balm on them, which was a very intriguing finding."

I like how creamy and tropical the scent is, but I think it is a little boring for its price. To me it smells very much like milk [in the opening notes] and mango [in the base]. On my skin it lasts for about 3 hours, and sillage is quite poor.Do I think that it is a nice summer perfume - yesWould I run to the perfume shop to obtain it - noIt is quite nice but lacks the complexity in its development, as well as I, personally, can't smell neither coconut nor tiger lily - the notes that were the main reason I was excited to try it out in the first place."

On paper, the coconut opening was so lovely and tropical, and then it faded to the scent of freshly cut mango. On me, I can barely smell any fruit, and it just smells sweet and floral — a generic ""perfume-y"" scent. I'm so disappointed, as I would have absolutely loved this one for the summer, but I'm just not into floral-forward perfumes, nor ""perfume smell"" where I can't pick any notes out. I'm going to test this for a bit longer to see if I change my mind but I think this one isn't for me."

The other two barely lasted an hour I was very disappointed as I’d heard they were powerhouses. This Tiger Lily smells totally different to those two but it’s the best 👍
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Finally went to try this In stores and it’s definitely a love! This is not as patchouli heavy and sappy sweet as original (which I dislike). It has more of that all around lovely floral like ruby orchid and midnight (my fav flower bombs). This one may be my top fav though. It’s like simple but a heavy hitting floral that would work for every occasion. It’s also has diversity in the floral scents and I think the coconut 🥥 kind of ties it together and gives it’s a milky lactic flow. I can also sense the mango 🥭 giving it a tropical touch for sure! I still don’t find it super fruity thought just a light touch. It’s a versatile scent that will be my next purchase for sure! I’m a sucker for a great all around floral. V&R you never disappoint 🤍🤍🤍🤍

It's creamy/milky but I didn't smell the coconut milk at all. On the other hand, the mango is clearly recognizable and brings an exotic side to the whole. It is quite sweet but paradoxically I found a sour/acidic note which I disliked.Another ""summer perfume"" which will please many people but which didn't convince me (I must say I'm not a fan of this type of perfume).Strictly no relation to the original; perhaps we should stop making flankers of anything and everything in order to create new original perfumes..."

I already have the Lancome perfume. Tiger Lily is a little juicier, which I love, where the Soleil is more powdery/warm, but to me they are just sooo similar, practically the same.

There’s a full bottle on the waynow.i really enjoy the warm sweetness it gives off and the buttery mango note. Its bright and syrupy and addictive. Longevity is moderate as well as the scent bubble.

To me it smells like a solid combination of sunscreen + tropical shampoo. I don't necessarily mean that as a bad thing, either.

Yes, it is a pretty mango scent with jasmine and freesia but it lacks as far as I am concerned the addictive quality of the original Flowebomb. The OG Flowerbomb was an instant love while Flowebomb Tiger Lily is just a like for me.Actually, I know what it is. It has a slight unpleasant sour twist in it that stops me from fully loving it. It doesn’t give me expensive tropical fruits vibes unfortunately like Cruz del Sur 2 or Sunplosion. I would say it reminds me a bit of Lattafa’s Yara Tous which is not really a favourite of mine. And I already bought that one so I definitely don’t need another mediocre mango scent.Cannot comment on longevity because I just sample it today but it doesn’t seem to be a week scent from what I can say so far.Want to try on a later occasion for sure because it’s a scent that I want to love and maybe after giving a few tries, I would end up loving it. When that happens, I’ll update here my final thoughts on Flowerbomb Tiger Lily! So far not entirely what I was expecting…Edit 10.05.24 Tried this again in store and it’s growing on me.

Way better than that ruby orchid mess they released last year. The coconut is creamy, and play with mango well and creates almost a mango lechada type of scent. Delicious, and almost drinkable smelling. I do not detect the lily, which, thank god, is one of my least favorite notes. It’s just more of a nondescript white floral undertone. I really do like this, it’s very sexy and tropical, perfect for a summer vibe. I’d have to wear it more, but that’s just my first impressions.

At five minutes I get mostly flowers, just a hint of coconut and mango (which fade quickly). At an hour it's floral and quite powdery. After that, the powder starts fading and it's got more of a savory-sweet note, presumably the benzoin; it's quite vanillic throughout.It doesn't really remind me of Flowerbomb, which for me is a good thing. However, I also don't get much fruit, which is sad. I wish I was getting the mango others can detect. This is one of my better-liked tries, but I wish it were less powdery and more fruity."

All I get is very strong florals, something powdery, and the barest hint of mango in the top note. I agree with a review below that said it felt like a very heavy scent for summer. I need to stop blind buying Flowerbomb. The notes sounded like everything I love, but I'm disappointed."

I get a little tiger lily, but from the beginning, it's the mango that's most prominent. Very sweet and surprisingly powdery. Flowerbomb Tiger Lily is a characteristic scent, not offensive, but you'd probably have people around you wondering where that smell is coming from— for me, not really wearable, but smelling it does lift my mood. Lasts a while and colors the whole room.I got this as a free sample, full disclosure."

The main notes are coconut and mango--the mango is very ripe fruit (when it gets really soft and almost buttery) and the coconut is gentle, rounding off the florals. I like it, but I got it as a free sample, no money spent, and on a day when lots of little annoyances were piling up, it cheered me up quite a bit.Very strong, very long lasting, and one spritz projects like mad."

I don’t mind OG flowerbomb, I like orchid, and LOVE nectar. I wasn’t really interested in this one because I’m not big into coconut fragrances but this is very nicely done! The coconut is there but somehow you don’t focus on it. It has depth and character making it more versatile than another sunscreen perfume. Longevity is great just like the others and you could smell it around me all day. 10/10 check it out."

Tiger Lily is no exception. I was a bit surprised that I didn't like it, because I usually enjoy tropical notes of coconut, jasmine and mango. But for me, those notes were barely detectable. With just one test spray, I experienced a very loud, slightly sharp floral (I presume lily and freesia notes) and it lasted on my skin for a whopping 12 hours! The drydown is better but not worth the unpleasant sensation of an oncoming headache that I experienced for the first several hours of wear. Utimately, it is just too obnoxious and screechy for me."

Well, I broke rule number one and bought the lastest Tiger Lily It doesn't have the typical Victor and Rolf dna which I DONT like. This was my 1st Flowerbomb. Sephora was having its 20% off sale, I bought it knowing I could return it if I didn't like it. Well....its going back. Why? Bc its designer blah. Its cute but no VA VA VOOM.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a beautiful fragrance and was a love at first sniff for me. The original Flowerbomb is a powerhouse and a classic for a reason. Prior to sampling Tiger Lily, I expected to smell more of the original DNA in this, which is why I wasn’t in a rush to smell it. When I did, though, I realized what a gorgeous fruity scent this was. I don’t agree with the comparisons made regarding this fragrance - from Alien Goddess to Pink Sugar, I respectfully disagree. To me, this is a fresh take on a summer scent - it’s juicy, yummy and bright. I also don’t agree that it smells generic (a favorite word among reviewers when it comes to fragrances that just don’t work on them). The biggest similarity to the original is its warmth, something that V&R do so well. It’s warm sunshine in a bottle with a burst of juicy fruit and perfectly balanced sweetness. It also has the signature longevity of the original, which I greatly appreciate. What a refreshing take and pleasant surprise. Beach or summer scents tend to fall into 4 main repetitive categories - sunscreen, coconut, salty aquatic or overly sweet fruit cocktail masquerading as tropical. This is none of those. It’s a sophisticated take on a warm weather scent.If you’re looking for a sweet (but not overly so), warm & beachy compliment magnet - she’s the one."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It’s a stretch to have released this as a flanker to Flowerbomb. The og dna is vaguely detectable after about an hour of wear, but it’s hidden beneath a realistic fleshy mango paired with louddd white florals. The original ironically smells more original and unique despite its popularity. Besides the 101 flowerbomb flankers, there’s nothing that smells quite like it. Flowerbomb Tiger Lily is definitely more generic and a touch more “perfumey” but i don’t hate it, i actually really like it. You have to be a white floral lover to enjoy it, but the mango adds an interesting juicy depth. This is by no means a juvenile body spray scent, i think it personally leans more mature. It gets better as it develops on skin and the performance is on par with the rest of the line."

It smells like vacation. I love this type of thing for fun occasional wear but for me this scent profile isn’t signature worthy. So I’m happy just sticking with Yara Tous instead."

I get next to nothing of Flowerbomb. This is a milky, floral mango. The projection is minimal but it seems to stick around a bit. On my skin I almost get a powdery mimosa.

It literally smells like poison. It's a hot steamy mess of way too many notes and a mountain of synthetic sugary sweetness to top it off. It's trying to be too many things at once and the end result is a weird frankenstein science project. They should have created a new summer fragrance, not shove the flowerbomb dna there by force, aren't there enough flankers already? Maybe if you spray this very lightly it might work?? Or not.

The similarities stop at the bottle. Perhaps that is because I do not smell fresia in the original.Tiger Lily's opening and dry down are like wearing two different scents. Extra sweet coconut milk and lily opening, but in an hour or so it loses its tropical vibe and morphs to deep, almost musky, freesia scent. It gives me strong Darling by Kylie Minogue (the original circa 2007ish) vibes after it dries down.Overall I like, but not enough to buy a bottle."

The dry down happened, and well, that mango kicked in full swing… and then just overtook the rest of the journey.Although the mango isn’t “synthetic” smelling, the dry down on the test strip and wrist became only mango, which was very overpowering, and I couldn’t detect anything else. The longevity and sillage are great, but I was hoping for the mango to be the icing on the cake… not the cake, the icing, AND the fork."

There’s a coconut background similar to what you’d find in a body mist, but not much else is distinguishable. The perfume has little dimension which comes off as messy. The original Flowerbomb, even the Nectar version are so iconic and contributed something to perfumery, but the flankers have been hugely disappointing. Also this perfume doesn’t hint at the original Flowerbomb at all it might as well have stood alone.Won’t buy. Not at the price.

As I wore the fragrance in store while checking out some makeup I fell in love with it. I have never been a fan of the OG Flowerbomb because of the patchouli, I can agree with other reviewer that this flanker has nothing to do with the original DNA. It opens with an irresistible full blast of coconut that's refined and elegant but not sunscreeny (coconut lovers rejoice!), immediately after you get the florals and mango. Performance is moderate so far. All the notes persist through the life of the fragrance. I believe I found my favorite coconut fragrance."

I feel like I was searching for something like this for a while, I wanted to find an Escada like this. They all had no ""body"" to them though and didn't last. Soapy and artificial, even if they are pleasant and refreshing. This is amazing though. The mango isn't strong, soapy or ever present, but it is there for a good amount of the wear. The coconut is more there to add the creamy, almost lactonic element, and isn't juvenile at all, along with the florals. Elegant but bright and happy. Versatile too, I feel like this can be worn all season and occasion.I have not enough experience with the flowerbomb so I can't comment on how this compares, I judge it on its own."

Im also glad that this flanker doesn't have the typical Victor & Rolf dna, bc its the 1st one from the brand that I like. Finally! The OG Flowerbomb was released 19 years ago and there have been almost a dozen flankers, but AT LAST they are selling something I actually want to buy. This opens to a great photo realistic topical wonder with coconut, mango, and juicy exotic fruits. Just as quickly as it squirts on you, is how quickly that loveliness leaves. Its so short lived that even if you're not into gourmands so can wait a few minutes to let it pass to appreciate the nice fruity floral that takes over. Its not super loud or over polarizing like the others in the brand. Its safe for work but you can most definitely turn this baby up too! I look forward to when this hits the gray market so that it can move my wish list, to add to cart! The performance isnt that great. Make sure you at least check it out though!"

A lovely addition to the Flowerbomb line! It does still have the Flowerbomb DNA, but it’s definitely different… it has its own beautifully unique scent. I think Nectar is the furthest smelling from the original Flowerbomb, but I think Tiger Lily is the 2nd furthest.All of the notes are noticeable to me, but the ones that stand out the most to me are the mango, coconut milk, jasmine, and tiger lily. It’s a gorgeous tropical and beachy twist on the classic Flowerbomb that’s perfect for spring and summer. There’s even a nice fresh scent to it from the bergamot and benzoin.I’m a huge fan of beachy/coconut fragrances, and I adore the Flowerbomb line, so I was just dying to get my hands on this new one! It sounded like everything I love! I can be funny about certain tropical notes though, like mango, pineapple, guava, ect. So, even though I had to have this one I was just a tiny bit nervous if I would truly love it. It just arrived today, and I’m happy to say that it definitely doesn’t disappoint. The first initial blast did give me slight pause, but within 5 minutes it had developed into a gorgeous beachy and tropical version of the Flowerbomb I have loved for so many years.I get excellent performance with Flowerbomb Tiger Lily. The longevity is great, it lasts the entire day on me. The projection is nice too, it radiates out at least an arm’s length from me. I don’t need much to get this effect, so I also think that it’s a good value for its price.For reference, here’s my basic thoughts on the different fragrances in the Flowerbomb line:Flowerbomb - romantic, classic, & floral - springRuby Orchid - sweet & sexy gourmand fruity floral - springNectar - sweet, flirty, & happy candy like floral - anytimeTiger Lily - bright, happy, & juicy tropical fruity floral - spring & summerMidnight - seductive & sensual floral - spring & fall"

I like the opening a lot, it's got this earthy almost spiced smell. It's beautiful. But as it dries down that tiger lily is headache inducing and gives neroli vibes. Also very animalic. Strong jasmine. My boyfriend said it smelled like actual feces. Which is what he always says about jasmine heavy scents. It's just okay. Not very sweet at all and I definitely can't smell any mango."

Then it turned into pencil shavings on my skin. So glad I didn’t blind buy."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I smell no Flowerbomb DNA in this. Disappointed
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I like the OG Flowerbomb a lot, LOVE Flowerbomb Nectar, and I like Ruby Or hid a lot, too. YSL and Viktor and Rolph are my favorite designer frangrance houses. I haven’t tried Tiger Lily yet. However, based on the reviews, even contradicting ones, I think Mambo by Liz Claiborne sounds very similar. It smells tropical without the sunscreen/coconut, you can by a 100ml bottle for $16-$20, and it lasts 6-8 hours on my skin. For those who were disappointed in Tiger Lily, you should definitely check out Mambo."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"At first when I tested this on paper, I got a very bright, juicy long lasting mango. But on my skin I definitely get more florals, warm and sweet reminiscent of the original flowerbomb, with a nice touch of mango and a hint of coconut.It's winter now here, and although fruity it still smells apropriately deep. I'm curious to see how this smells in summer and if the fruity/coconut notes come alive more! But I feel like you could wear this year round, and both day and night. It feels happy, fruity and sweet, very feminine.Longevity and projection are great, it easily lasts the whole day on my skin, on clothes and paper a lot longer. I feel like it projects well for around 4/5 hours. After that it sits closer to the skin, but definitely still there. Again, this is in colder weather.I like it a lot, and I will consider buying a bottle if the prices come down or if they come out with a 30ml bottle. Very nice addition to the flowerbomb line."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"White florals, soft coconut, juicy mango.Such an amazing scent! I am verrrryyyy picky with my scents and hate anything too heavy or sweet.I only own light florals.This is so likeable and I have not smelled this combination somewhere else. Its very expensive and I wish there was a 30 ml version. Its almost my birthday, so I will ask my dear boyfriend to get this for me;)."

I love OG flowerbomb and I don't find similarities in them. But I will say this has great longevity and I still smell the mango 6 hours later. I'd say this is worth a try if you like Fame but dislike the bottle, or if you generally enjoy warm summer scents in the fruity-sunscreen category"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Beachy, coconut, and more fruity than floral sweetie for not just summer 🏝️ ⛱️... It reminds me very much of Trésor La Nuit Nude by Lancôme. I was expecting a tuberose after first sniffing, so I was surprised there wasn't any present in the notes pyramid. But I guess white florals count as one. Might be too coconutty for some, mango, as many report here truly is MIA, at least in the opening. But I do get it a bit in the dry down. Overall it's more creamy, lactonic even, well rounded tuberose/white flowers fruity scent in my book that besides beach will stand well in an Opera house, cocktail party or at the dinner in a vacation resort restaurant. I'm a self proclaimed tuberose whore, so once I deem something a tuberose fragrance (even it is officially not) it's just an instant love for me and that's it. ✌️🙏"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Like @mqkm said, it smells like a coconut body lotion, mixed with some sunscreen scent.

I didn’t like it one bit, it smells sweet and generic. Even for a summery scent, it doesn’t stand out in my opinion as there are much better options out there (Olympea Solar being my pick). This is just boring."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Ruby Orchid meets Dolce Shine. There you have it. I have both of these fragrances but still got V&R Tiger Lily. It’s at Sephora now. However that might be redundant to have all those 3. Nice scent. Coconut is strong. Definitely lots of jasmine. I get no mango but it’s sweet.Great scent. Easy reach.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My local Sephora had a few travel sprays of this in stock. No tester or full bottles though, so I wasn’t able to properly get my nose on it. I decided to take a leap and make it a blind-buy.…And it was a success! I cannot wait until spring and summer to wear this. As I sniff, I’m getting the florals of the original Flowerbomb with a healthy dollop of sweet coconut and a touch of mango. It does have a slight “sunscreen” undertone which usually bugs me (unfortunately that’s how my nose interprets coconut notes), but I actually love it this time. It’s not straight-up “Banana Boat” vibes. Instead, it feels like I’m vacationing at a fancy resort, and I’ve just put on perfume and a nice dress for dinner after hanging out by the pool. Just like…floral and beach-y.So yeah, this will probably be THE summer fragrance for me this year!"

I used to wear Flowerbomb when I was 21, it was my go to.The Ruby Orchid is a bit too sweet for me.Enter Tigerlily!I love white flowers, freesia and tropical fruits. This is very soft sweet without being too overwelming.Will get it for my birthday in april!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,It’s okay but way too screechy of a fragrance for me. Smells cheap and it’s pricey for a designer scent. Didn’t enjoy wearing it so I sold my bottle. Still the only flowerbomb I enjoy is nectar.Performance was moderate.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Another house taking an iconic fragrance (which I have respect for so I was excited to test this) and using its name to create a boring beachy, fruity, coconut white floral. Personally I detect no OG dna in this. This smells like a mix of D&G Dolce Garden, Olympea Solar, Angel ""Elixir"", Alien Goddess, Born in Roma, D&G The only one intense and so on. Super pedestrian and basic, not in a ""safe and pleasant"" but ""spend your money on a useless product"" way"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I just received it and from the first impression I love the Mango note at the start but it faints quite quickly and all the solar notes come out what gives it the Alien Goddess vibes to me. At the dry down the original patchouli dna comes in and bergamot what im not a big fan of, for the same reason I dont like Coco Mademoiselle. Its ok, not a must have, I might be spoiled with niche perfumery and look at designer fragrances a bit different. Anyways if you enjoy fragrances like Alien Goddess or any of those beach vibe designer florals, you will like it. I will most likely pass it on. I wish that mango note lasted longer at the start."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,So I’ve smelled this very sweet (almost cloying) girly perfume at Gatwick airport today. And must say it’s very much coconut and fruity coconut body lotion. I’m glad I did test it but I won’t be buying as I do have Lancôme La Vie Est Belle Soleil Cristal with coconut accord and it’s nicer.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Just purchased this and it is so tropical, juicy, and floral. I didn't even know this was a new launch so I guess I'm early to the party. This is my first ever Viktor Rolf purchase. Never tried their stuff despite seeing it everywhere, because I was rather intimidated by the title ""flowerbomb"" because I don't like insanely floral scents. However, I was at Macys looking for a spring/summer feminine fragrance and decided to test the flowerbomb line. The OG was too floral for me, so I was correct in my assumption. However, the Tiger Lily stood out to me. It was not overwhelmingly floral. It has a fresh zesty opening with watery coconut notes, and then dries down with a very ripe juicy mango, surrounded by white florals and sweet benzoin. I have a feeling people are going to say it smells like sunscreen. Coconut and Mango tend to give off that vibe, which doesn't bother me in the slightest. Performance wise, this lasted 6+ hours on me with a good sillage that is not too overpowering. Gorgeous perfume that I will be wearing all spring and summer (:"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,On paper it smelt like Fame by Paco Rabbane but when I tried it on my skin. I get more of a creamy milky mango with a touch of Lily. The paco rabbane one smells like vanilla and sandalwood on me. So I’ll most definitely be getting this one. The mango note is stronger on the skin.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Tested it today. To me it smells very similar to Paco Rabanne Fame. It is creamy and smooth in the opening, I detect the coconut. After that I get lots of jasmine, and the mango/benzoin base comes through quickly as well. Gets quite dense towards the dry down. I think it's a nice scent, but it doesn't wow me. For me it is not enough to justify having it in my collection."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The scent is available for sale in the Netherlands from today. I smelled it and immediately purchased it. It is tropical in which the coconut milk and lily play the leading role. It is made more playful by the mango. It is absolutely nothing like previously released 'Flowerbomb' perfumes or any perfume above. It is somehow reminiscent of Tom Ford's Soleil Blanc, but with mango as an extra addition.The scent is nothing new or unique. But qualitatively the best of its kind."

As I wore the fragrance in store while checking out some makeup I fell in love with it. I have never been a fan of the OG Flowerbomb because of the patchouli, I can agree with other reviewer that this flanker has nothing to do with the original DNA. It opens with an irresistible full blast of coconut that's refined and elegant but not sunscreeny (coconut lovers rejoice!), immediately after you get the florals and mango. Performance is moderate so far. All the notes persist through the life of the fragrance. I believe I found my favorite coconut fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Viktor-Rolf/Flowerbomb-Tiger-Lily-88986.html,Flowerbomb Tiger Lily Viktor&amp;amp;Rolf perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"A beautiful, bright, happy, feminine, sunny, juicy, tropical, fruity floral. A lovely addition to the Flowerbomb line! It does still have the Flowerbomb DNA, but it’s definitely different… it has its own beautifully unique scent. I think Nectar is the furthest smelling from the original Flowerbomb, but I think Tiger Lily is the 2nd furthest.All of the notes are noticeable to me, but the ones that stand out the most to me are the mango, coconut milk, jasmine, and tiger lily. It’s a gorgeous tropical and beachy twist on the classic Flowerbomb that’s perfect for spring and summer. There’s even a nice fresh scent to it from the bergamot and benzoin.I’m a huge fan of beachy/coconut fragrances, and I adore the Flowerbomb line, so I was just dying to get my hands on this new one! It sounded like everything I love! I can be funny about certain tropical notes though, like mango, pineapple, guava, ect. So, even though I had to have this one I was just a tiny bit nervous if I would truly love it. It just arrived today, and I’m happy to say that it definitely doesn’t disappoint. The first initial blast did give me slight pause, but within 5 minutes it had developed into a gorgeous beachy and tropical version of the Flowerbomb I have loved for so many years.I get excellent performance with Flowerbomb Tiger Lily.

Tiger Lily is no exception. I was a bit surprised that I didn't like it, because I usually enjoy tropical notes of coconut, jasmine and mango. But for me, those notes were barely detectable. With just one test spray, I experienced a very loud, slightly sharp floral (I presume lily and freesia notes) and it lasted on my skin for a whopping 12 hours! The drydown is better but not worth the unpleasant sensation of an oncoming headache that I experienced for the first several hours of wear. Utimately, it is just too obnoxious and screechy for me."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Since Guidance, I think Amouage have enjoyed appealing to the TikTok crowd and are creating mass-appeal fragrances which are (sadly) less uniquely stunning creations they are world renounced for. Love Delight is chemically harsh and smells like a jumble of synthetics that can’t blend calmly. Smelling it feels more like huffing a hairspray solvent. I wanted the cacao, vanilla and heliotrope/almond but I don’t get gourmand, I get some kind of nail polish/acetone scent. The dry-down is a cool, mineralised bitter lemon that reminds me of a floral disinfectant. Probably the most disappointing Amouage to date sadly."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Love Delight by Amouage, reminds me a lot of Soleil Blanc and Eau de Soleil by Tom Ford, and of Beach Walk by Replica. All of them have the mold and rotten fruit smell I can't digest. On top of that, Love Delight projects a spicy ginger note which makes this perfume different from the other three mentioned."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Most wonderful fragrance by Amouage! It's incredibly pleasant and comforting. It's like being surrounded by pure love 💖
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Sadly not for me. The mix comes of somewhat sweaty - like wearing perfume after a day of sweating (not the smelly armpits kind, just the long day kind). Probably just my skin chemistry but my wallet's intact."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Oooh spicy orange upfront. Peppery ginger and cinnamon. Really enjoying the tingliness of the ginger. Powdery floral combined with vanilla smooth into something more lightly creamy, the ginger still there but less prickly. Cocoa and a not very boozy rum come in.Fully dried down I'm enjoying different notes coming in and out each time I smell my arm - spicy but smooth, powdery cinnamon vanilla, rum-iness. I swear there's a watery note and I don't find it overly gourmand, perhaps some florals tamping that back?For Amouage it's not a particularly challenging scent and Interlude Woman is still my favorite.But it's nicely made, lovely, and still luxurious."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a beautiful floral gourmand and is not what I normally expect from Amouage. It's very creamy and silky. Easy to wear. The dry down is beautiful. It has decent sillage and this is the type of scent that men love to smell on a woman. It's sweet, creamy, floral and feminine. It lasts on me a good 6 hours which isn't a bad thing. I don't need perfume to always be beast mode and linger on my clothes through a wash cycle. I've had this for a few months and I don't always reach for it, but when I wear it I ask myself why I don't wear it more. It's just so pleasant and comforting and not like anything else I've smelled before. I don't recommend wearing this on hot humid days. This is a better scent for cooler weather in the fall and winter."

Lovely ginger and orange opening. In the dry down the heliotrope and jasmine with the vanilla adds a pleasant creaminess, but somehow it is powdery at the same time. The cacao peeks out in the background and makes it more interesting."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is my first time testing perfume with a ginger note but I’m loving it so far. Opens with a strong ginger and vanilla with the cocoa peeking out every now and then! Thoroughly enjoyable, but if I’ll buy a bottle is another matter entirely…🙃"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Ok this smells really good! It’s not groundbreaking but it doesn’t have to be. This is one of the more mass appealing scents from Amouage. Love Delight is a softer sweet scent. I’m in a phase where I find a lot of sweet scents cloying so I don’t want anything too strong. I get citrus and ginger in the opening but on skin it dries down to a slightly spicy and powdery vanilla. I do smell rum but fortunately it’s not a boozy scent. Very feminine and versatile scent for almost any occasion.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Love Delight is a relatively discreet perfume for an Amouage. It is not an extremely different and groundbreaking scent either, although the combination of its notes may sound peculiar.To my nose, it is a perfume that, after a sparkling mandarin opening, feels like a warm but refreshing composition, if this is possible, where cinnamon, jasmine and a prominent vanilla are the main notes, accompanied by a heliotrope that provides a powdery base. Personally, I have not perceived any other notes on the two occasions that I have worn it, although perhaps the cocoa contributes to reinforcing the effect of the heliotrope.Those who know Amouage perfumes will also recognize in this perfume that somewhat sharp something that I think must correspond to one of the substances that the brand uses to fix its perfumes.In this case, the sillage is quite prominent for the first couple of hours and then becomes more moderate, lasting on my skin for about 10 hours.It's a perfume that I like and that I find pleasant to use in spring, summer (if the day is not extremely hot) and autumn but that I personally would not invest in, since it has not won me over.Scent 6/10Duration 1010Sillage 7/10Quality/price 3/10Versatility 6/10Packaging 8/10Would I buy it again?

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Citrusy, orange, ginger, cinnamon and rose, there’s a lot going on here right from the start all the way to the end but not overwhelming. It’s not too sweet, not too loud and as it dries down becomes a softer, but still strong and fresh feeling gourmand leaning floral scent. I’m guessing the heliotrope and cocoa make it feel a bit powdery, which I love. I also get a bit of liquor/rum in the base.I wouldn’t class this one of Amouages Masterpieces, nothing out of this world - but still gorgeous!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Tried out Love Delight by Amouage today, and it was instantly good—like being wrapped in a fluffy vanilla cloud. It has this bubbly and spiced profile that draws you in, feeling deep and sexy yet somehow soft and floral at the same time. Perfect for when you want something sweet but with a little edge."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"When I first smelt this fragrance, I thought...Playdoh. No, no....Peach Bellini. No, no....Sweet Tarts? It changed so much just in the first few minutes on the skin, but then it finally started to settle and became sweet and boozy. It's along the lines of scents like Side Effect, Angel's Share, By The Fireplace.....but sweeter. It's made as a Women's fragrance, but it easily be worn by anyone who likes sweet scents. Something in the profile ever-so-slightly reminds me of Overture Woman, but just barely. I feel like you can pick out individual notes at times, but everything blends together so well. Definitely worth a try if you like Boozy, Gourmand, Sweet scents."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"These are the kind of perfumes you fall in love with instantly: you want to keep sniffing them again and again. Of course, it's because of the beautiful vanilla bean, which is executed so incredibly well here. They might seem a bit ordinary, the notes are very familiar to the nose, there are no trendy molecules or interesting combinations, but at the same time, they're extraordinary: you can't always create new, incomprehensible fragrances. Although the notes are ordinary, how beautifully they are executed and balanced. Vanilla bean, rum, a hint of cocoa, flowers – everything is so familiar, yet so new and exciting. A perfect balance, nothing extra. A very successful composition, I'll probably never buy it for myself, because the little voice in my head telling me not to spend money will get the best of me. :/"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Hm... This list of notes is definitely not what I feel... For me it sounds like creamy peachy osmantus... Really melted peach ice cream based of pure heavy-heavy cream base. Wher is rum, ginger, orange, cacao 😁 No way! But it's very good, playful, positive vibe composition. Easy to love."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It smells so juicy and spicy for the first few hours (the orange, ginger, and jasmine really come through), but about 6 hours later all I am left with is the cocoa and rum. I was hoping it would be a bit more bright, and I wish the citrus and ginger lasted longer on me. The sillage is weak as well which is disappointing."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I'm having trouble getting a strong sense of this one via my dabber sample, but it's like a vanillin-tinted banana with some dry spices. It's jaw-achingly sweet, and the scent is already fading, so I suspect this is more a skin scent. Probably a pass for me. I'm not getting a lot of depth, more like a linear vanilla banana candy or something."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I wanted to love this due to the notes and didn't want to love this due to the price. Looks like my wallet won. I just don't love it. It's ok and I'd like to smell it on someone else but not myself. It's not a gourmand to someone like me who likes sweet smells like Lira or even vanilla insensee. It has this odd plastic note.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"When I first sampled this in store it made me think of Rolling in Love, but with a fresher green thing added to it- I guess the cypriol? I ordered a decant and in the air it’s reminding me of Rouge Malachite but with this green thing + bready/buttery pastry smell. Interesting because this perfumer created both of those fragrances. So it’s almost like a new take on those. I feel Ike to my nose on paper and on skin this is very floral (heliotrope? Jasmin?) and not really gourmand. Well not like a cupcake, more like a buttery pastry."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This smells like rice porridge with too much cinnamon sprinkled on top (nordic ones will understand). After the cinnamon heavy opening this settles to a rosey cacao with other spices. Very spice, NOT a typical gourmand. If Lira is a spicy gourmand, then this is a whole spice cabinet with dark cacao chocolate. This is not my type of fragrance, so I obviously won't buy this. Regardless, I truly appreciate the art behind this unique spicy scent. Smells like my childhood Christmas mornings. Even though I appreciate this perfume, I don't find the scent very pleasant on me, it's not wearable for me :( I would not have named this ""Love Delight"", I would have named this ""Love Disgust"". I'm sorry but this is NOT wearable."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,When I first tested this in winter time I liked it but I agreed with those saying it is more mainstream than most Amouage fragrances. Now that it is hot this is really shining. The rum and cacao really stand out along with the spicy notes of ginger and cinnamon which are my favorites. I am finding the longevity and sillage improved in the heat as well. Saving up for a FB.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I found this perfume to be very unique personally because I usually can't stand scents that contain Jasmine/Gardenia/ Tuberose and the likes. However this one is so creamy without that nasty bitterness/ screechiness that pretty much all perfumes that contain these flowers have-theyre nauseating to me but not this one. This one I could sniff all day and can't get enough. It's delicious yet beautiful. It is unsurprisingly long lasting just like Guidance (another favorite from the house) and projects beautifully on me. I catch whiffs of it all day and really really enjoy it in the summer. Loveeee!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I received a sample of this and at first spray, it immediately reminded me of Lattafa Fakhar Rose. I can smell the differences but they are very similar IMO. ...and I'm not sure what Fakhar is inspired by."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"So far, this is my favourite out of the Secret Garden collection. The spicy, gingery note gives the scent a fizzy orange vibe, especially when you first spray it, which I loved. I liked the vanilla dry down too. I thought the scent was quite linear overall, but that didn't really bother me, as I rather enjoyed my fizzy orange scent bubble.Overall, I like this fragrance very much. Just not quite enough to buy myself a bottle of it."

Arranca elogios onde quer que vc vá! Fresco, mas cremoso e atalcado, um gostinho doce, tipo chantilly que é doce na medida certa. Mas não se engane, dura horrores, projeta muito. Nessa belezinha a Amouage entregou TUDO! O cheiro me remete à um colar de pérolas, com fecho em diamante, todo em ouro - claro!"

So pleasant and delicious. Sweet and saltyI don't know about the longevity or the projectionwe spent 2 hours at the mall, so I can’t really tell, but the silage is pretty good"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is very interesting and growing quickly on me. For me not as simple as it initially appeared but also a departure for the house. Feels more like a Memo Paris fragrance.Initially on opening I got a buzzy orange wave of scent which was unsettling but quickly flowed into a gingery orange blossom type scent.At this point I felt it reminded me of Classique Essence for a few minutes. After trying them out side by side I can see similarities but they are ultimately quite different.The scent settled and gets more fluffy/creamy and weighty giving a certain amount of heft that is surprisingly long lasting - with a blurred floralcy (I can’t pull the notes apart) on a creamy woody structure.Deeper in the dry down I’m getting some interesting green notes floating on the sweeter vanilla and floral heart. Like crushed Ivy after you had a walk in the rain. It’s really adding interest and stopping it from feeling bland.I am definitely surprised to be enjoying it so much. It’s not as obviously sweet as the rest of the secret garden line, and not the bland, boring fragrance many are slating it as either. It’s a new middle ground for Amouage. Less gourmand but definitely gourmand leaning.I miss the more complex releases of the house but have still enjoyed the recent releases. I’ve snapped up many of the complex discontinued frags and have a few more to go. I can’t help but think the house may need to watch it doesn’t regress to the mean and lose its edge (differentiating points) to gain more market share. The price point already keeps it out of reach of many. If they keep heading towards the mass there may be a shrink instead. Few will pay such eye watering prices for designer worthy scents - given the constant price hikes we are seeing in the space (Rant over).I’m very pleased to have been given a 5ml decant as a birthday present and will enjoy this as we enter winter.But please Amouage, give us something truly unique and a hair challenging, in your upcoming releases."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This short review is based on a sample. More detailed review will follow later after having a full bottle.The other day I sprayed this one a lot in my arms. The scent was nothing special - nice but not any wow effect. The day after I was wondering what a beautiful intoxicating whiff was lingering in the air. I realised that it came from the little sample bottle which has been leaking out.Beautifully hazy, powdery, sweet aroma like a sugar dust with gentle spices, Vanilla, Rum and Cacao. Absolutely attractive and indulgent! The scent around you is this kind of but it smells totally different close to the skin.If my sample wouldn't have been leaking I think that I would never had experienced that beautiful part of Love Delight. I was so underwhelmed while sniffing my arm. This is not so recognisable Amouage, it could easily be from some other house as well. Nevertheless I think it fits well into Secret Garden Collection in which the perfumes are not so complex and they are more crowd pleasing than Amouage in overall. I'm curious to see how this performs during wintertime.Thank you for reading and if you want to follow me on IG: @ninamariah_perfumes"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Don't let the notes fool you. It smells like an incredibly sweet, sticky mango. the last note is close to Guidance of the same brand."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It is really similar but at the same time it’s very different. I don’t like cacao note in the perfumes. I thought it was sharp, sweet cacao perfume. But no, it is not. It’s very perfectly blended. I wore this perfume yesterday and my clothes still smell.The only thing I would criticize is the opening part, which smells of citrusy cleaner. When it dries, it doesn't have this effect, but you have to love citrus for the opening part."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Love Delight has an unexpectedly sharp citrussy opening which is almost astringent; presumably the mandarin and ginger. I thoroughly enjoy the zing of the opening. This rounds into a sweet nutty mid which is quite delectable. I really get a well blended fusion of cacao, rum and some florals. I realise the general consensus amongst the fragrance community is that LD is representative of Amouage losing its edge by going in a less complex, more crowd pleasing direction. I can see that this is less challenging than typical offerings from the brand and I can see it having mass appeal. I enjoy the heart as the fragrance does not lean too far in any particular direction, the citrus notes do not burn off immediately in the top, it has floral facets and subtle gourmand elements too. Very feminine but disappointingly the dry-down ends up as your average bubblegummy sweet fuity white floral."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Edit as of 6/1/24: Love Delight and MAB Tilia are soooooooo similar!!!I don't quite know how, because the notes and scent profile are pretty different, but Love Delight somehow reminds me a lot of Prada Paradoxe Intense. They're like second cousins. I think it has something to do with the Orange/Jasmine/Vanilla combination. Love Delight has actual Mandarin Orange fruit, while Paradoxe Intense has Orange Blossom and Neroli. My nose still just somehow interprets them as something citrusy orange, coupled with the Jasmine and the Vanilla. I would say that Love Delight is creamier and smoother than Paradoxe Intense, and then powdery from that Heliotrope. This is probably why people are saying it doesn't smell niche enough, because it's not challenging, like most Amouage are. If you already own Paradoxe Intense, I don't think you need this. If you don't, but have liked that DNA, then you will probably really like this. Something in the deep drydown is really reminding me of Levant by Ormonde Jayne, maybe it's the same Mandarin note. Love Delight is also very longlasting on me! I definitely got around 8 hours before it became a skin scent, and even then it was still apparent! Question though, how is this categorized as a warm spicy?? To me it's more of a powdery floral citrus... strange!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I really like the scent but the longevity puts me off.

Due to the price it’s going to get a thorough test before shelling out this kind of money, but I adore the way this flipped from fresh and fruity to warm and sultry in the dry down.

It is such a gorgeous mix of white florals and sweetness. The opening is predominantly jasmine to my nose, but it evolves so many times over the next few hours. The orange and ginger join the jasmine and give it an almost honeysuckle feel, then you get the suuuper creamy heliotrope and vanilla. By about ten hours in I could still fully smell this but it had dried down to something sweet and powdery. Sprayed on clean moisturized skin about 24 hours ago and I am still getting traces of it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,The opening is very bright. You can smell the orange and the ginger. After a couple minutes it settles. Creamy and powdery at the same time. You can really smell the rum and cacao in the dry down. Heliotrope lasts throughout the entire fragrance.Wouldn’t call this a gourmand but as far as Amouage goes this is the most gourmand of the range. Much better than guidance which I find woody above everything

It’s a safe blind buy imo, a very mass appealing fragrance. Very feminine, sweet, voluptuous and loud, and uncomplicated. It’s quite linear and can get cloying if oversprayed. The Amouage juice quality is top tier as usual, this fragrance will get you noticed. It isn’t unique, but I can’t pinpoint exactly what it reminds me of. This creamy-citrusy gourmand start seems to be a popular trend we can spot across many fragrances."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Unfortunately all I smell is the Cypriol oil. It's a very mature scent because of that. It smells like something musky and woody from Avon in the 90s.

Notes all came through in the wrong order for me, and the first I picked up on were the cacao, (which was more like cocoa butter to me) cinnamon and vanilla. Basically a cake. The mandarin and floral notes came through afterwards. Everything was perfectly balanced, smoothe and in moderation. Niche or not it is a great scent"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I totally agree this smells just like Initio High Frequency. I will say I like the dry down better in Love Delight beautiful fragrance with a little quirkiness.

I was impressed at the top and middle notes: boozy, sweet, powdery floral, which reminded me of Heroine by Boadicea The Victorious. However, the last note was totally awful...it smelled like TriBeCa which I DISLIKE very much, and the Baccarat Rouge 540 vibe, which is nauseating and sick!!! Influencers and people online should stop lying to get attention from Amouage or whatever! THIS IS CRAP."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I ordered a whole bunch of samples and sniffed them blindly, which works really well for me because it’s a good way to tell if I like/dislike a fragrance without being influenced. When you don’t know which perfume you’re smelling and what notes you’re ‘supposed’ to smell, you don’t have any expectations and can form your own opinion. Anyway, with this one I wrote down ‘tuberosey - perfumey - L’interdit Rouge - Ruby Red’. After seeing which perfume it was, I looked it up on Fragrantica. Apparently there is no tuberose in this fragrance, but I can understand why I thought of L’interdit Rouge and Ruby Red. It’s not that they smell similar, but they all have that creamy orange, ginger, white floral combination."

I am always looking for gourmand fragrances that I can wear as a non-gourmand lover and this is absolutely one for the list.To me, Love Delight is bright, fizzy, sweet, and warm. It gracefully evolves on the skin. While the initial citrus and ginger brightness fades a bit, the spiciness and freshness of the ginger and cinnamon combination lingers on my skin for hours. I want to keep applying not because it doesn’t last ( I get good longevity on my skin, about 8 hours) but because it keeps me interested and it layers so prettily.Although longevity is good, projection is moderate."

I also got a decant of Xerjoff La Capitale for which I will be forking out for a fb, and that is even slightly more stupidly expensive per ml but it inspires the kind of love that makes it worth. For me this does not.I love the bottle and the execution is perfect as it does smell to me just like a fluffy sweet lightly spicy middle eastern dessert. I'm going to keep trying with this.

The mid is nice too (this is where I get a lot of the fluffy heliotrope) but the dry down is the best part to me - I'm a sucker for those gourmand notes. I will agree this isn't your typical Amouage fragrance as it's not as ""challenging"" as some of their other offerings but all in all, I think I'll pick up a bottle. And speaking of the bottle, it's cute. Not quite as gorgeous as Guidance but since I can't get with that one, this will do just fine!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I don’t know what I was expecting with this scent. I don’t even remember why or how it ended up on my “to test” list. This is nothing like I expected. It opened with a citrus bomb I wasn’t a fan of at all. Then it began smelling like cologne. Now it’s dried down to something that smells green, herbal, but sweetened, and it comes off rather synthetic on my skin.I think this is the Cypriol note. I was hoping for a spicy cinnamon ginger flower bomb. Instead I got green cologne with a small dash of vanilla mixed in. It becomes more waxy and synthetic the more it dries down. Flowers don’t really stand out. This fragrance feels muddy. Dries down to a sort of green musk that feels a bit like play doh. I never got the spice notes.I’d say this is more masculine leaning unisex. It doesn’t read very feminine on my skin. I honestly thought this was going to be a scent I loved, or I suppose at least one that would “Delight” me. It’s not. I will spare readers a long rant of everything I dislike about it. Just not for me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,She’s cute. She’s mainstream. Good summer scent. I won’t be purchasing but it’s nice!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I had to buy Lilac Love on the grey market to avoid this awful new packaging. Also I wanted all the Garden bottles to match. Unfortunately I wont be able to do anything about Love Delight since it’s fairly new. sigh.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Amouage is a house that im struggling with cause their fragrances are very complex and not everybody's cup of tea however this is their most crowd pleasing scent since its not super complex .White florals with a boozy Rum note in the opening and a very refreshing spicy Ginger Note. Drys down to a stunning floral sweet scent thats very feminine and screams elegance in my opinion. If it wasn't so expensive I think if it wasn't so expensive every woman would buy this.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Fluffy sweet orange Creamsicle frag with a touch of rum
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,The opening was so beautiful. Then it does that weird thing in the middle that's classic Amouage but can be so off putting. The drydown once its about to wear off smells nice.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Glad I gave this a try, its a femine fluffy scent. The opening is almondy milky with a hint of spice, the mid is floral-slightly gourmand. Its not too sweet, just right and somewhat addictive. Layers well with so many fragrances like soie malaquias, hundrent silent way, cuir beluga.The price point it definitely a bit too much bit if you like it why not!!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Very nice female frag, nothing to do with the Amouage ID. It’s nice, very reminiscent in the dry down of YSL’s Manifesto, but less rich. It is office safe, blind buy safe and overall utterly boring. Has Amouage started catering to the masses lately?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Lovely feminine perfume but extremely overpriced. I own the fancy love perfume by Jessica Simpson and I find them tk be similar. Love delight is creamier and superior in composition though. lasting power is good but it sits close to the skin from the beginning.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My dear sweet tooth friends:) 👋🏻This is really delightful fragrance! Really, truly !Everything is balanced here: not too sweet, not too powdery, airy and soft, very feminine and gentle, gourmand but elegant.The rum note ( which automatically is associated with men) doesn’t make this perfume neither masculine or alcoholic nor vulgar.It is delicious 🤤 …But in every ideal story there’s always one “but”.The Love Delight is 1:1 twin with Bois Amande Van Cleef & Arples to my modest nose…Where Bois Amande is very loud and harsh in the opening, Love Delight seems to be more delicate .. however after some time these two are so much alike that I even became proud of myself to remember that and compare them 😎Anyway, please try them both … one is expensive and lavish , another is affordable and stylish :)Good luck and be inspired 💋"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Totally agree with @honeysuckle85 - smells like ex nihilo.I recently purchased a bottle of Vesper Glitz (not sure why, a bit impulsive, haven't worn it since) - and this smells exactly like Vesper Glitz in the opening. Looking at the notes, you wouldn't expect it, but essentially this is a sweet, lightly gourmand *white* floral. I don't get rose."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This yumm. But soo dang expensive. Can't afford it 🤣🤣💔
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I am a bit underwhelmed by this. It smells mostly like creamy heliotrope with a bit of a dessert essence. A lot lighter compared to others from the brand
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"While there is a fair amount of creamy vanilla, we're not dealing with baked cookies. Although that is likely subject to change from person to person. There is a floral presence, but blossoms very warm and full bodied. Love Delight is sophisticated, but safe for Amouage. It's a fun fragrance that will be enjoyable for Spring and other seasons going forward, as it is versatile. Unlike Guidance, which is amazing but a cold-weather performer at best. I imagine anyone adding Love Delight to their collection, will find it easy to reach for. Don't be intimidated by cacao. It's there, but doesn't make the composition chocolaty in any way. I find that it provides a certain balance between bright florals and sweet vanilla. Ginger and cinnamon are so well blended, that it's not apparent that they are present. It seems that for every aggressive or spicy note, there is a softer or sweeter note to counter. I find that what I'm smelling perfectly reflects the aesthetics of the bottle. The color scheme speaks to a composition that is pleasant, bright, warm, floral and just sweet enough."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I’ll go straight to the point with this one - it doesn’t smell like your usual Amouage fragrance, it smells like Parfums de Marly or Ex Nihilo release. That been said, Love Delight is beautiful, it opens with peony and mandarin, rose water and the opening on my skin stays there for the entire longevity of this fragrance. It evolves into a fluffy, sweet scent; never cloying though. It reminds me of a fluffier Fleur Narcotique, at least on my skin. As you might notice from my description, Love Delight is not unique and it has an insane price tag. For instance, Guidance is unique, and everyone is amazed when I’m wearing Guidance “what are you wearing?” they keep asking me, however Guidance can be tough sometimes.. By contrast, Love Delight is easier, definitely more wearable despite not lacking of elegance, it’s suitable for every environment either you go hiking on the hills and you want to smell beautifully, if you are fraghaed you are crazy as I am and you hear me, or for a night out. If you think that Fleur Narcotique is beautiful but too airy at times, if you think Oriana is too sweet and not refined enough to be chosen everyday, and of course you don’t own both, give Love Delight a sniff."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Well, I will say Jus de Rose nailed it in her recent description - I don’t have the words but this individual certainly was able to pin point it perfectly in her description. Opening is lovely (cake with almond powder and spice), middle cacao is playdoh. Longevity is good however NOT worth the hype (very mass appealing)Price Is INSANE 😂"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Nothing like the notes described in here or as advertised and not gourmand at all. Even vanilla is pushed far back and hides in the shadows far into the dry down. And I'm not even getting any rose, which is not a problem for me as I'm not particularly a fan of that note. It does indeed smell too generic, with exception of very good performance. I find some note of combination of notes resembling the scent of holly berries (or a similar bush that has berries on during the winter), kind of like eucalyptus... For me it is just way too weird. Such a pity, I'm glad didn't blind buy the whole bottle. Will have to sample this again in a year or so, to see if maceration can improve anything."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"very generic imo, i really wanted to like this the notes seem heavenly. 😭"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"What a beautiful floral scent! Might be a crowd pleasing one but try before you buy! It’s got some sweet elements but it is not a sweet perfume per se. If you like a refined jasmine scent with some sweetness and a bit of a spicy kick, this might be for you. Has something very synthetic upon dry down though."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The reviews for this fragrance are all over the place. Personally, although some are saying this is not sweet, I definitely perceive it as sweet and having a gourmand feel to it. It is kept from going full pastry mode by the ginger and florals. This is definitely jasmine centric. I had two friends smell it on me. One perceived it as a gourmand bakery scent, the other thought it was a tropical gardenia scent (she must have been picking up on the jasmine). It seems that different people perceive this fragrance very differently. For me, I get a bit of a pastry vibe. Sweet with cinnamon sugar and a good dose of ginger. Definitely jasmine centric. The opening, which many others have said, is definitely the best part, but I don't feel it changes drastically in the dry down. The mandarin does fade after the opening, but the other components hold strong. This is mostly a jasmine vanilla ginger cinnamon scent to me. Floral and gourmand. Definitely sweet. I could not envision a man wearing this. Very feminine and very pretty. $380 is a steep price to pay for any fragrance in my opinion, but there's a high chance that I will snag a bottle of this when I can get it on sale!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is basically jasmine and heliotrope forward perfume, with some cacao in the background. Would not call it gourmand and I don’t think it is particularly sweet. Definitely not a safe blind buy, as always test first. It is a pass for me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a very beautiful, light and delicate gourmand perfume. It really smells like those magical deserts described in the Tales of 1001 Nights- rose water, Almonds, fluffy cream, ginger all spun into airy folds and whirls. It is so different to other Amouage perfumes which I would classify as quite bold and heavy. I have all the other garden collection, but this one is the lightest. The sillage is modest but longevity is good. It leans feminine due to the sweetness, but it isn’t going to give you toothache. Although they are not all similar in smell, it gives the same impression of a delicate rose confection as Safran Troublant by L’Artisan Parfumeur, which I also love."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This will be a crowd pleaser especially if you’re starting out with niche fragrances. This is a very safe blind buy imo. It’s fresh, floral and has that deep dry down of vanilla and rum. It’s smells zingy in the beginning from the ginger and orange. I also get a fizzy almost champagne note that settles after some time. The rose follows along. This is very delicate and creamy scent but not in a milky way. It’s a pretty girl fragrance, not a seductive sexy girl scent. If I were blindfolded smelling this, I would think this is a new release from Parfums De Marly. It’s smells simple and put together for a ultra feminine girl.Not the greatest longevity for amouage but decent enough to wait for a discount in price to purchase!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This has a bit of the play doh type vibe that Hypnotic Poison has. Also Limitless Shopping by Trussardi has a similar feel. It must be the heliotrope combined with something else. I get something tonka-like in here also. If you like the fragrances I’ve mentioned then you’d probably like this. It’s pretty, not unique though."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This smells very familiar. It’s very perfume-y if that makes sense. On me it is a sweet, powdery, jasmine heavy scent. Only opening note I can pick out is some of the mandarin orange, jasmine and heliotrope in the middle, and a slightly woody/green vanilla in the dry down. It’s not spicy, or rum heavy, the cacao is hardly present l. I can’t smell any of the ginger or cinnamon either. It honestly reminds me of a more grown up Paco rabanne Olympea. Like if you took Olympea and toned down the sweetness, and added some powder to it. Or, like the jasmine in mugler’s alien, slightly cleaner with more powder. I’m also reminded of the slightly woody drydown in a lot of afnans perfumes. Is it well blended? yes. Longwearing? Yes. Super strong? No, I would say about medium projection. It’s soft and a little cozy. I like it but it’s not unique enough to purchase a full bottle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Prada paradoxe intense and Fleur Narcotique layered ...Very underwhelming. And hilarious lasting power for the price. Guidance remains unbeatenFollow me on SCENTUALP - TikTok and instagram
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It is love at first sniff for me, a very vell blended floral perfume. I think the main note is the creamy jasmine but not an animalic indolic type much more than a gardenia-white flowery type. I'm suprised that I read that some say that it is a soft and short lived scent becouse on my skin lasts all day and has a big sillage- just like the other member of the Love- series (exept Blossom Love becouse that is burning my nose so strong).Love Delight is absolutely not challenging, I think it's much more wearable then most of Amouage- but it is definetely very beautifule and complex. Overall I will buy a whole bottle soon, it's beautifule for spring, summer and autumn, a very sensual and feminin scent that I love so much."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"To be honest on first test this was very underwhelming and ... not consistent with any of the notes? On my skin it was pulling almondy, green... tuberose-y. It gave me the feeling of a very well blended designer fragrance. Couldnt put my finger on a specific scent it was reminding me of, but just designer with better ingredients is what i was getting. Someone compared it to Givenchy l'Interdit and i could see that actually. Not bad. Just really nothing to write home about on this one. Very disappointing coming from the house and bc the notes were so interesting to me. Definitely sample first, notes were way off imo 😅Upon first impression: 6/10 scent. 5/10 when taking into account the price point. Will have to revisit again for final opinion"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,There is something synthetic about this that deters me from buying a full bottle. For a better flormand I recommend Marfa by Memo Paris.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I expected to not like this one or to be underwhelmed, but I forgot that Amouage isn't really a house that I love. Some of their more popular fragrances I have found to be too much. So, I really like this fragrance. I do feel like it has somewhat of a designer vibe though. I actually found myself comparing Givenchy L'Interdit Rouge to Love Delight. Ultimately, I think I will wear this decant quite a bit. I do not think that I would pay retail for this, but would definitely buy decants or wait until it is discounted. Ultimately I think it is a really pleasant, wearable floral with some spiciness and a touch of sweetness and maybe something a little fizzy -- think Dr. Pepper."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Very weak. Zero sillage! only you will feel it when tuck your nose. The scent it self not bad, soft feminine, but not edgy, lacking character, after Guidance, so nothing special."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Smells like Fleur Narcotique/ Valaya at first and after an hour you can get the rum and deeper notes. Prefer Guidance 😀
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This just smells like a mix of Armani Code and Armani Code Cashmere to me!Some spiciness at the start followed by strong orange and jasmine. I get a slight hint of cacao but I wouldn't say this is gourmand in any way. I don't get any of the rose.It makes sense that this was made by Pascal Guarin, if you are a fan of his style, I think you'd certainly like this.Personally I like this, but won't be purchasing a full bottle for the price. I can see this being a love or hate, depending on whether you like that kind of Thierry Mugler Alien type jasmine DNAupdate: I really dislike the dry down, it feels rough and smells like a dated 80s jasmine perfume"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I got myself a large decant of this. It’s beautiful and I’m enjoying it but I’m not sure I’ll buy a full bottle. I get a lot of rose water from it. And an underlying sweetness. But it’s mainly a powdery jasmine. Aside from the rose water which is used in many Middle Eastern pastries, it doesn’t give me a gourmand/dessert impression.Lasts a good 6 hours on my skin."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Real review from someone who has had the fragrance and worn it non stop for a few days now. I am going to highlight the good and the bad so you can decide if it is worth having. So, let's go...The good:The notes described here on fragrantica are spot on. In the opening, you get ginger, rose water sprinkled with a tad bit of cinnamon. In that order. This fades out about 15 to 20 minutes in and it turns to the orange which remains prominent for about 30 minutes. Slowly, the sweeter notes enter the room and dance beautifully with the orange and the top notes take a subtle back seat. As all the notes mix, the scent remains unique, feminine and gorgeous. I would dare to say it is easily crowd pleasing!The bad:Do I think this one is over hyped a bit?? For the scent, no. It is gorgeous. For the performance, yes. It starts off strong, but just as the notes exchange places in the center of the stage, the performance also takes a step back. While it lingers just fine and I would not describe it as a skin scent, it is definitely more on the intimate side. That said, I can still smell it on my clothes the next day but only if I put it up to my nose.In summary:If you are looking for a gorgeous Flormond, look no further. If you are looking for something work appropriate and a day wear, this is your scent as it will not disappoint. However, if you are in the market for a beast mode scent that will introduce itself when you enter the room, this is not for you.All in all I am glad to have this in my collection. I love Amouage. I will compensate the intimacy of this fragrance with extra sprays because it is def what I was looking to add to my collection.Scent: 10/10Longevity: 6.5/10Sillage: 5/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I can see how many will enjoy this, especially if you are new to niche because this is more mass appealing but for me it was a big let down. I’m glad I resisted the temptation this time and didn’t blind buy it but instead got the sample set. The opening is gorgeous, no doubt but that quickly fades into your average department store perfume. I was shocked by that since this house especially isn’t known for making average smelling perfumes. This has a lot of heliotrope and jasmine. I wish the scent I got in the beginning stayed a while, bummer. Pretty yes… pretty boring, also yes.Performance wise it is very poor, especially for an Amouage. I know it’s a new release but I’ve worn it twice and it just fades to a skin scent in less than a few hours and I’m not someone that has trouble getting perfumes to project/last. Will retest again in the coming months to see if anything changes but for now it’s an easy pass.Update:Wore it a few more times and honestly, it’s nothing special. I feel like this is such a rip off for both the scent and the performance. I only like the opening even though it’s not a wow, it’s pretty but the dry down definitely smells like some sort of dated designer perfume. Yes, not everything has to be groundbreaking but we’re talking $380 dollars here so…A lot of hype for nothing. I question the reviews that say it has great performance because I asked some friends around me and they could not smell it either unless they were sniffing my arm directly. I also had them spray it on their arms and after the first 30 mins passed, I could also only smell it up really close to them. Please sample first because this was not at all what I expected. I will say this perfume would be great for someone who wants an intimate scent, the kind you have to come in for a hug to smell and for someone who also likes more designer smelling perfumes and wants something with a little niche flavor to it but not much."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I agree with everything Olgita stated in her review. This was very underwhelming to me. I have tried all the other Love collection fragrances and they are ALL beautiful in their unique ways, with stellar performance. This once starts out very beautiful in the opening. Fruity, spicy, feminine and sweet. However when this starts to dry down you are left with a very run of the mill jasmine, heliotrope scent that you can get from the Macy's counter. I was expecting much more from this as I own 4 Amouage fragrances. Love Delight just does not stack up to anything I've experienced from the house in the past. Amouage scents are challenging to many but we can all probably agree that one thing you will never walk away saying, when testing their scents is ""that was boring."" Well, Love Delight had me walking away saying just that."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My bottle has just arrived so, I have spritzed and am reviewing in real time. First impressions? Gorgeous! Warm, spicy, almond, ginger, marzipan but the floral notes ensure this is not just another gourmand. I definitely get the mandarin and rose. Feminine and sexy. It’s a blind buy win!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Risky blind buy, but wow love at first sniff 😍I get predominantly cinnamon & ginger in the opening and soon after jasmine appears & sweet almond from the heliotrope giving almost a pastry/croissant-like. It settles into a vanillic base with a touch of cacao & rum.. the cypriol gives slight earthiness feel. Falls into the floral gourmand category which is a great addition to the Secret Garden collection & clear winner for me. It's not chokingly sweet which I prefer.. Such a refined take on a gourmand. I do think this is an easy love from the beginning coming from Amouage as of date. Wore it this evening & was just swooned by the scent.. compliments right after!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I just received my bottle and this is first impression review. I am a big fan of Amouage and love and ware a lot of their fragrances (in feminine and masculine bottles alike), but Love Delight is not a love at first sniff. On my very cool skin Love Delight is a ginger prominent fragrance with a lot of heliotrope and jasmine. I love rose and vanilla and unfortunately ginger is the most dominant note that I get with very little to no sweetness. The ginger in Love Delight reminds me of the ginger in Memo Paris Vaadhoo (the scents are not similar, just the ginger note). Performance is also worse than what I’m used to from Amouage. I understand that this is new release and first test only, so I hope it will improve over time, but as of now it is minimal projection with moderate longevity. I can see that this fragrance will do well in cool transitional spring and fall weather and is mostly a daytime scent. To my nose this is straight unisex due to strong ginger and aromatic aspect. I do not find this gourmand at all so please test first as this is not a safe blind buy, especially for those who want feminine gourmand scent.EDIT: It’s been several hours since I put this perfume on and now ginger is fading turning into jasmine and heliotrope dominant fragrance with ginger in the background. Still no rose, vanilla, or gourmand sweetness."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This must be so dreamy and feminine.. I already love Guidance.. can’t wait to test this new release!

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Angel Share comparison? really? 😂 I mean I see where you are coming from, but lets hope not.Love collection is my favorite from Amouage, I can not wait to smell it. Just placed an order. Amouage doesnt disappoint. Thank you for thinking of us ladies, who love feminine fragrances.Update 05/17/2024When I first got Love Delight, I wasnt impressed and dint care for it, but as I began wearing the fragrance, it grew on me each time i would sniff a whiff of it. Its a huge love now. I do wish it wasnt as fleeting, the performance is quite softer than I would expect from Amouage. Starts out strong but faints down within few hours to soft sillage, Id say I get about 4 hours before I feel like I have to reapply. For some it might be positive thing. I dont like my fragrances beast mode, but dont mind having good performance, this one just falls a bit short on performance even for me.As for the scent itself, this isnt a sweet gourmand, to me its mostly powdery slightly sweetened Heliotrope with some ginger and a bit of cinnamon, rounded with some vanilla, thats what I get the most from the fragrance. I am not huge fan of ginger in fragrance but I find here ginger and cinnamon is well balanced too, not overpowering. Its definitely feminine leaning. Its unique, I dont think I can compare it to anything just yet, so that makes it worth a spurge."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Real review from someone who has had the fragrance and worn it non stop for a few days now. I am going to highlight the good and the bad so you can decide if it is worth having. So, let's go...The good:The notes described here on fragrantica are spot on. In the opening, you get ginger, rose water sprinkled with a tad bit of cinnamon. In that order. This fades out about 15 to 20 minutes in and it turns to the orange which remains prominent for about 30 minutes. Slowly, the sweeter notes enter the room and dance beautifully with the orange and the top notes take a subtle back seat. As all the notes mix, the scent remains unique, feminine and gorgeous. I would dare to say it is easily crowd pleasing!The bad:Do I think this one is over hyped a bit?? For the scent, no. It is gorgeous. For the performance, yes. It starts off strong, but just as the notes exchange places in the center of the stage, the performance also takes a step back. While it lingers just fine and I would not describe it as a skin scent, it is definitely more on the intimate side. That said, I can still smell it on my clothes the next day but only if I put it up to my nose.In summary:If you are looking for a gorgeous Flormond, look no further. If you are looking for something work appropriate and a day wear, this is your scent as it will not disappoint. However, if you are in the market for a beast mode scent that will introduce itself when you enter the room, this is not for you.All in all I am glad to have this in my collection. I love Amouage. I will compensate the intimacy of this fragrance with extra sprays because it is def what I was looking to add to my collection.Scent: 10/10Longevity: 6.5/10Sillage: 5/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"My bottle has just arrived so, I have spritzed and am reviewing in real time. First impressions? Gorgeous! Warm, spicy, almond, ginger, marzipan but the floral notes ensure this is not just another gourmand. I definitely get the mandarin and rose. Feminine and sexy. It’s a blind buy win!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Risky blind buy, but wow love at first sniff 😍I get predominantly cinnamon & ginger in the opening and soon after jasmine appears & sweet almond from the heliotrope giving almost a pastry/croissant-like. It settles into a vanillic base with a touch of cacao & rum.. the cypriol gives slight earthiness feel. Falls into the floral gourmand category which is a great addition to the Secret Garden collection & clear winner for me. It's not chokingly sweet which I prefer.. Such a refined take on a gourmand. I do think this is an easy love from the beginning coming from Amouage as of date. Wore it this evening & was just swooned by the scent.. compliments right after!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Angel Share comparison? really? 😂 I mean I see where you are coming from, but lets hope not.Love collection is my favorite from Amouage, I can not wait to smell it. Just placed an order. Amouage doesnt disappoint. Thank you for thinking of us ladies, who love feminine fragrances.Update 05/17/2024When I first got Love Delight, I wasnt impressed and dint care for it, but as I began wearing the fragrance, it grew on me each time i would sniff a whiff of it. Its a huge love now. I do wish it wasnt as fleeting, the performance is quite softer than I would expect from Amouage. Starts out strong but faints down within few hours to soft sillage, Id say I get about 4 hours before I feel like I have to reapply. For some it might be positive thing. I dont like my fragrances beast mode, but dont mind having good performance, this one just falls a bit short on performance even for me.As for the scent itself, this isnt a sweet gourmand, to me its mostly powdery slightly sweetened Heliotrope with some ginger and a bit of cinnamon, rounded with some vanilla, thats what I get the most from the fragrance. I am not huge fan of ginger in fragrance but I find here ginger and cinnamon is well balanced too, not overpowering. Its definitely feminine leaning. Its unique, I dont think I can compare it to anything just yet, so that makes it worth a spurge."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Very nice female frag, nothing to do with the Amouage ID. It’s nice, very reminiscent in the dry down of YSL’s Manifesto, but less rich. It is office safe, blind buy safe and overall utterly boring. Has Amouage started catering to the masses lately?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,What I don’t understand how come a fragrance is not even out at the stores and people already comparing it to others ? ??
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I agree with everything Olgita stated in her review. This was very underwhelming to me. I have tried all the other Love collection fragrances and they are ALL beautiful in their unique ways, with stellar performance. This once starts out very beautiful in the opening. Fruity, spicy, feminine and sweet. However when this starts to dry down you are left with a very run of the mill jasmine, heliotrope scent that you can get from the Macy's counter. I was expecting much more from this as I own 4 Amouage fragrances. Love Delight just does not stack up to anything I've experienced from the house in the past. Amouage scents are challenging to many but we can all probably agree that one thing you will never walk away saying, when testing their scents is ""that was boring."" Well, Love Delight had me walking away saying just that."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is basically jasmine and heliotrope forward perfume, with some cacao in the background. Would not call it gourmand and I don’t think it is particularly sweet. Definitely not a safe blind buy, as always test first. It is a pass for me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Very weak. Zero sillage! only you will feel it when tuck your nose. The scent it self not bad, soft feminine, but not edgy, lacking character, after Guidance, so nothing special."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Amouage/Love-Delight-89959.html,Love Delight Amouage perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Unfortunately all I smell is the Cypriol oil. It's a very mature scent because of that. It smells like something musky and woody from Avon in the 90s.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I got a sample of this and some other JHAG scents a while ago and I just keep on coming back to this one. It's nothing special; a sweet, tart cherry with a jasmine base, but it's just so smooth and pretty. Sits close to skin but lasts quite well and turns into a warmer floral with a hint of cherry, remaining fresh/light throughout. It's young but not juvenile, basic but it has some personality, girly and sweet but not in an overly cutesy way. It lacks depth but layering, especially with its sibling Not A Perfume, can surely assist with that. I'm trying my best to criticize it but even with its faults, I adore it so much I had to order a full size."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Just bought the sample, at first I thought it was super basic. After leaving it on for a while it's totally grown on me and I love it but unfortunately the longevity just isn't there :/ It's just really subtle and actually not what I expected. Just be prepared to have it spray it a lot. The drydown is gorgeous though"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I actually find it boring even though I thought I would enjoy it. For me it doesn’t smell at all like cherries, more like musk and jasmine"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This is a well-balanced floral cherry. It’s very pleasant but it doesn’t move me. Nothing overly special or memorable in my opinion. Decent longevity.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"At first yes it seemed basic, but then I wanted to smell more of it...and it just made me spray some more and more! 😆 I will wear it this automn and hopefully won't get tired of the scent quickly."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I'm surprised with these reviews and I don't think this is boring at all. This smells like an edgier version of Donna Born in Roma, probably due to the woodiness. Does not smell ""girly girl"" at all. Suitable for a stoic goody two shoes with a dark side perhaps."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Getting white florals and pear/cherry and musk. Nice but doesn't interest me much a bit boring
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"To me I certainly don’t dislike it, but it’s a very young fragrance to my nose. I’m 45, for reference. I’m going to give my daughter the sample because I think it would suit her better. I’d put it in the same category as the Britney Spears or Ariana Grande scents, which I used to love wearing but are too sweet for me now."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Sharp and fresh at first sniff. I get the alcahol vibe everyone is talking about. After the dry down it was so faint I could barely smell it. Seemed pleasant enough for a hot day but nothing special that I would reach for.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I enjoyed it until it dried down . I thought it was ambergris, I get the same issue with the dry down of vanilla woods and angel and a few others, it smells musty in a bad way . I like the fruitiness to it , it reminds me of the define me Barbie just the tiniest bit , they both remind me of grape juice. . This one would be a winner if it weren’t for the dry down . I do get a slight similarity to the idea to dullness which is my fave from them. . It kind of smells like the Barbie perfume mixed with ode to dullness"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The jasmin combined with pink pepper creates a similarite to Donna Born In Roma. This smells floral, but in a soapy and sharp way. I do not enjoy smelling this. Smells too much like a banal perfume."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I’m pleasantly surprised with this, I was expecting more of a sour tart scent. The opening does lean slightly medicinal because of the cherry, but it settles into a clean, creamy white floral. Almost reminds me of the white floral in good girl by CH. I’m unsure whether it’s worth purchasing the full bottle for the price, however."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I did not think I was gonna like this as much as I did. I went into the store to find and smell a completely different Juliette Has A Gun perfume that they didnt have but I'm so glad I found this one in mini discovery pack alongside Not A Perfume. They layer together wonderfully but Juliette alone also smells delicious. It starts off with that sharp sour cherry then transitions to a warmer cherry. I could not stop smelling it over and over again and loving it more and more. I also loveee the bottle being this beautiful dark blood red.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Juliette is simply okay to me - nothing about it stood out and made me want to pick this one from JHAG's lineup. It's tart cherry intermingled with white florals which aren't my thing. This also has the same kind of cashmeran type smell that's in Ode To Dullness in the drydown. I don't think it smells medicinal as some cherry scents can tend to do. If I want a cherry scent, I'm going for Cherry Punk by Room 1015."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is cute (sorry, best word for it). It's very young in my opinion, nothing particularly ""childish"" about it, and I can see a woman of any age enjoying it, but there is something very playful in a teenage way. It even reminds me of Fantasy by Britney Spears (at least early 2010s formula). It's clean like a fruity body wash, and it's freshness kind of reminds me of orange blossom. Definitely a chasmeran note.... the worst note ever on my skin. Luckily everything else is quite overpowering! And overall it's a very strong scent, great sillage from what I got to test from a sample. Throwing words into description salad: fun, young, playful, clean, sweet... Recommend trying it if you like (not similar, just vibe): Magnolia Bliss, Chance Eau Tendre, Paradoxe"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Opened with white flowers so strongly I thought there might not be any cherry in it. But the cherry showed up after about 3 hours. Overall it's sweet and feminine in a generic way, nothing stands out about it. It feels a bit juvenile on me, and very much like something I've smelled before.Tried a sample from the discovery set, worn once."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Delightfully sweet in the opening but I'm finally giving up on testing new JHAG releases, they ALWAYS use cetalox in the base notes and it makes me feel ill :( I guess that's their ""house DNA"" or whatever... To give an entirely conflicting opinion, my mum has loved every single JHAG sample I've passed on to her thus far! (NAP & NAPS, Pear Inc, Lili Fantasy and now Juliette.) Longevity of about 7 hours but with very minimal silage."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I know that this perfume disappointed a lot of people. But I am not one of them. I got her as part of a travel size set along with Not a Perfume. And I LOVE her. This is a signature scent worthy fragrance. It starts out as a realistic sour cherry and then turns into a beautiful, delicate white floral scent with a bit of sweetness. I have worn this fragrance to weddings, as my signature scent on vacation, and just day to day. I have dreamt about this perfume! I will absolutely be picking up a full bottle and hope to always have it in my collection. Projection is light to moderate and it lasts on my skin for about 6 hours, but goes to a skin scent after about 2-3 hours.Update: Bought a full bottle, still obsessed. Performance is better than I remember it being when I had the little travel size."

I know it has sweet cherry notes but on my skin I get a not as intense alien at first.. the Jasmine is definitely forerunner with a fun wispy cherry note, definitely an intoxicating alluring scent, alien lovers I’m sure will love some Juliette.Feel this scent would also easily work well all year round or at least a nice summer evening scent..Wonder how’d this layer with Dolce Q or I want Choo forever??.."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I just have a little 7.5 ml bottle of Juliette, and full disclosure, I initially bought it for my fiance. I just liked it so much that I kept it myself lol but I had already gotten her a Juliette Has a Gun sample pack, so I think it had Juliette in that. I have a few feminine leaning fragrances that I love myself, and this is one of them. I love that sweet, tart cherry scent, and the floral scents are really pleasing to my nose too. I really want to try Sunny Side Up next, because I read that it's supposed to help boost your mood. I've been pretty depressed lately. I think my fiance has ghosted me again :-("
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Opens up as quite an interesting spicy cherry. However fades quickly to a fairly generic, and slightly dated, musky white floral. It’s also quite powdery, which gets more prominent the more it dies down. Performance below average. Not worth a full bottle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Julietteopens with a sweet, tangy, red-fruit-cocktail accord supported by the faintly menthol-fresh rosiness of pink pepper.The opening makes me think ofOff To The Racesby Lana Del Rey: a syrupy flirtatiousness that's at odds with the cool, filmy velvet of the mid and base notes. It's compelling, albeit slightly discomfiting. Sadly that's where my interest ends.Within ten minutes,Juliette'sdrydown is already well underway. The fruity accord soon fades to nothing as the cashmeran becomes increasingly dominant: fuzzy, filmy, and dry—like velvety wood fibers and dust on stone. It's backed by cool, plastic-y jasmine—a combination that's distinctly reminiscent of Mugler'sAlien. Like a woodier version of Alien, with a fruit-cocktail opening.Alienhas never been my scene;Julietteeven less so."

The fresh citrus opening blends into heart of florals and spices, with a warm, lingering finish of musks and woods.Versatile and perfect for both day and night, the fragrance lasts a solid 8-10 hours with moderate sillage. The sleek packaging reflects its edgy, modern vibe. Despite the mid-range price, the quality and distinctiveness make it worth every penny.Highly recommended!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"as a perfumer, you are not understanding the relationship between sweet jasmine and sour cherry. yeah it's a little basic but it's also genius. you only get a title card fragrance once so consider it a serious offering from the brand. i got zero compliments but i smelled it for 30-40 seconds before i bought the bottle. do what you will :)"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I always find it so interesting how fragrances can react to skin so differently from person to person. On my skin, I get a huge hit of cherry in the top notes (it fades in about 10 minutes), then I get the florals and the base. This is not a complex fragrance at all, but I purchased a full bottle after sampling regardless of the simplicity. Personally, it reminds me of Tom Ford's Electric Cherry with a lower price tag. This is NOT a safe buy and it really needs skin to appreciate it. Not everyone is going to like it. Moderate longevity and projection. It's marketed for women, but I think a man can pull it off and I don't regret my purchasing decision whatsoever."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Was excited to get this. I smelled it in store and was happy that the cherry was soft since I’m not a cherry lover. I ended up buying it and I’m regretting it. The one I got has a very heavy white floral opening note that lasts a long time. For some reason when I smell the atomizer it almost gives me a BO smell and does the same on my skin.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"JHAG was a gateway to my current perfume addiction so I was interested to try this new scent which feels like a bit of a departure from the typical house dna. For those looking for a sweet cherry note, go elsewhere. This is a dark, sour cherry which makes it far more tolerable to this cherry note hater. The floral isn’t cloying and the underlying ambroxin (?) really balances the fragrance so it doesn’t stray too far into candyland. It’s very pretty. Sadly it has a super low silage and unlike other JHAG fragrances, lacks in longevity. If not for those factors I would absolutely add a fb of this to my summer rotation."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I got the JHAG exploration set with the tester of this and it was the first one I used up. I got compliments all day wearing this scent and couldn't stop smelling myself, either.It definitely has strong notes of cetalox which is JHAG's hero ingredient, but the cherry and pink pepper remind me of Glossier You but a tad sweeter. It manages to be sweet without being cloying or having that migraine-inducing sweetness some perfumes can veer into.I felt sexy in this fragrance! I was worried the cherry would skew juvenile but it feels adult and it dried down really beautifully."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Juliette is a fragrance for pink pepper lover. It's a simple combination of soft spice, white floral, and cashmere. I don't get any cherry, maybe some fainted raspberry notes if I try really hard, and that is fine. But I can see why the notes can be misleading and why some ppl might be disappointed. Overall a simple and soft fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I get the sour, but not much cherry. I get the pink, not the pepper. Very clean scent, heavy jasmine, not sweet to my nose. Pleasant, but still a bit disappointment for I was waiting something with more depth. It's quite generic, designer like scent. It develops better, I like it more after an hour or so, it gets warmer and less sour. I got a good deal when I blind bought this so I don't mind having it. I will have to wear this for a couple of days to really make up my mind.I'd say it's quite safe blind buy If you like this scent profile. I like my perfumes dirtier and darker and sweeter, but it makes a nice contrast for those. I tried layering with not a perfume and it works well."

This gets compared to Alien a lot but I’ve never tried it before so I can’t exactly say, though I’m suddenly very curious because I like Juliette but usually dislike white floral perfumes. I wouldn’t pay the money to have this in my collection but it’s a very pleasant scent to me! Never thought about blending jasmine and cherry but it works surprisingly well."

That's great if that's what you're into. My mom likes her perfumes to be very patchouli heavy...the dirtier it smells, the better. But I need some bubbly and sweet/sour to my fragrances...something with highs and lows. Perhaps this one could be great as a layer with something lighter and sweeter to uplift it."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Juliette-90396.html,Juliette Juliette Has A Gun perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Shockingly good!! This scent is certainly less cherry and more generally red fruit and a hint of spice with a creamy, soapy-clean and sweet base. Honestly, I am not a cherry perfume fan, and on a blotter, this is jammy cherry and something cola-fizzy and creamy in an unfortunately screechy way. I was not a fan on first sniff, but the red-fruit/cream combo caught my interest. On clothing, it's really lovely and magnetic. It feels very like a sophisticated and boozy cherry cola with a smooth creaminess to it. I can't stop smelling myself! As it dies down, it resembles the opening of Ode to Dullness and retains the spice with the creaminess though less of the almost sour musk that Ode dries into.It really feels in some ways spicy, sassy, lipsticky and cola-esque in a clean and soapy way. The jasmine here is really the MVP, blossoming behind the scenes and lending the clean, creamy qualities so that the red fruit and cherry can really sit in this spicy-cola realm.I think if you like fruit/spicy/smooth combo like Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry but you want something cleaner, this is a great starting point."

I do notice the cherry note, but I wouldn’t call it a cherry perfume. On me, it’s much heavier on the jasmine and pink pepper and after about an hour, the hint of cherry has totally faded. It has minimal sillage and lasts about 5-6 hours. In terms of perfumes listed as similar—❌ JHAG Pear Inc: much fruitier❌ Fine’ry Not Another Cherry: a much deeper and nuttier cherry scent"

When I smelled this in the store I had sprayed Kayali 28 so I think mentally I was tainted. It has the Ambroxan notes JHAG perfume is known for. I like but this made me realize I’m not a cherry fan.

Zero jasmine. The sillage was even “arms length” so I figured the actual perfume would be stronger.But then the heartbreak of realizing the Juliette you fell in love with doesn’t actually exist.The perfume itself starts with a medicinal, “inside of grandma’s purse”, cough drop. It starts to get less medicinal after an hour or so, but then you need to make it through the awkward jasmine phase. If you can make it to hour 3 without washing off, you will end up in that cozy cashmeran/tonka land with what I smell as sandlewood but that could just be that I’m new to those accords. It’s beautiful. I don’t want to stop smelling it. But I can ONLY smell it if I my face is touching my wrist and I inhale as deeply as humanly possible. Even if I over spray at first, it’s still barely detectable once you get to those perfect base notes.Downgraded from 🥰 to 😔.Sillage is strong when you don’t want it, gone when you do.Longevity about 5 hours. But remember if you reapply you’ll need to relive the heartbreak all over again."

HEAVY Jasmine here!Sure, the cherries are there in the background, but imagine a tiny little cherry tree overshadowed by a sea of big jasmine-scented bushes in front, behind and all around.Cashmere is also prominent here.Don’t let the color of the bottle fool you. In my opinion it is not like Lovefest burning Cherry or Lost C at all, the tonka is too non-existent for that. I think it is verry, verry similar to Alien!All lovers of perfumes with dominant white flowers will like this one! Good sillage and longetivity, just not up my alley as a gourmand-girl."

I can smell the cherry but it’s not as cherry forward as I thought it would be, it’s more in the background of woody pepper and floral and ambroxan.

The cherry is fresh, it’s not tart or even medicinal. But, it is hard to place in the fragrance because the pink pepper just dominates here. This comes off as a really strong, cheap body spray. I was looking forward to this release, but it’s a definite no for me. It’s not subtle or sexy, it’s loud and super unpleasant."

I understand everyone picks up on different notes in perfumes. I am not a white floral fan. However when white florals are well blended with other notes, a scent is more tolerable to me.With that being said, Juliette was an utter failure and disappointment regarding the cherry note. I don’t get cherry AT ALL. It’s pure Jasmine 🤢🤮. I had to wash it off immediately — I could not stand it.Also, I bought the travel size from the JHAG direct site and it came opened and 1/4 used. So be careful when buying directly from them. You sometimes get used product. What a waste of $40 I will be giving away.You are much better off buying 7 Virtues Cherry Ambition or Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry."

The marketing shows a vivacious woman looking so mysterious and full of adventure... I'm looking for that exciting verve-filled shout, and am only hearing a whisper. Maybe the deep dry down will reveal more, I hope. I am smelling more peppery and woody notes as it wears, and am liking it a whole lot more! Maybe that's the Cashmeran?""Cashmeran is a synthetic molecule that gives perfumes a warm, woody, amber scent, similar to cashmere wool. It's also known as ""cashmere wood"". Cashmeran is a popular ingredient in modern perfumery, and was created in 1965 by International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) as an alternative to expensive and rare natural ingredients like sandalwood and ambergris."" (Google AI)This bottle should have been light pink with very lighter pink color gradations.

It reminds me of Nirvana Grey, which is the most animalic musk I’ve ever smelled, so if that was a love of yours (RIP E&J Nirvana .. gone too soon!) and you don’t mind some extra sweetness, this could be a winner.While it’s not my cup of tea, I can appreciate that it’s got a lot of presence in the first 3-4 hours.

Suprême and VGG and its flankers are the only ones I care for."

It’s not a good combo! If you have smelt the blush version, the elixir is not similar. Blush is lightweight and uplifted while elixir feels like it’s confused on whether it wants to lean sweet vanilla or be “more grown up” and adds clashing patchouli/ bergamot. The miniature bottle is pretty but will not convert to a full bottle. If you want a warmer darker Good Girl flanker, get Midnight."

It got a bit headache inducing and nauseating, when I sat on a hot bus, but layer it with some fresh rose and you are good to go.Now that I’ve had it for months, the patchouli note is very prominent and when autumn comes, I might start layering it with Bare Vanilla to tone it down a little.I’m very much in love, but I would not blind buy this, because ot the rose and patchouli notes.

Hasn't there been many a fragrance done this way before? The typical bergamot, rose, mandarin orange, ylang ylang, patchouli, vanilla blah blah blasé derivative these brands like to rehash to the younger consumers now and then.

Creamy, woody vanilla and ylang ylang. Not too dense, I struggle with a vanilla note that is too strong, I really loved the balance in this perfume. (Risks getting cloying in warmer weather.) The mandarin opening was a pleasant, refreshing start that disappeared within minutes. Patchouli follows a little deeper, in the beginning it’s not very noticeable however gets stronger overtime. The next morning (12+ hours on skin) the woody notes and the patchouli were still prominent. The stranger that complimented described it as “clean but complex.”Woody vanilla is always alluring to me, and I love the projection of this perfume. Once it develops it keeps a consistent performance for a very long time. Rather hard to come by these days! I’ve personally had the experience of not being able to smell the Good Girl line on my skin except for Very Good Girl Glam and this one.On me the sillage was fantastic for about 5 hours and then it turned into a detectable, rather strong skin scent. On my friend it projected for 6+ hours.I’ve also tried the original Good Girl Blush, they aren’t the same. On me GGB had an animalic punch that doesn’t work well with my skin and lasted very little so we were incompatible, although I loved it on the tester strip. Elixir is the stronger, more potent and more unique version of GGB. (Doesn’t smell too similar to Montblanc Signature imo.) I’d say Elixir is less powdery, ylang ylang adds an interesting twist and contributes to the creaminess. It’s denser, doesn’t have an underlying fruity aspect accompanying it, GGB is more ethereal and put together than Elixir that is a bit more intoxicating."

This has too much patchouli in it which ruins the softness and its innocence.The term 'Blush' represents a shy, reserved girl. She wouldn't wear such a strong patchouli scent.This flanker doesn't match any of the other flankers either. This might be the strongest flanker of the entire GG line only because of the heavy patchouli. Okay so take Mademoiselle + Blush = that's the smell.100% agree with szania.

I will let you know my thoughts off the bat, and you may continue to read my review if you please: I neither like nor enjoy this iteration of Good Girl Blush.I remember the pink-cheeked, dewy loveliness of what vanilla and peony could do together in Good Girl Blush. It was so enjoyable to me that I took every opportunity to sample it, I almost, just almost, purchased a full bottle. So you can imagine that when I saw that patchouli had joined the band, I was immediately intrigued.In Good Girl Blush Elixir, patchouli although the usual suspect, is not the problem child. Rose is. I don't know where they obtained this rose note from, but it is sharp and headache inducing - a bit like the rose you'd smell in scented powder detergents. All this is worsened by a very strong vanilla note. Oh my goodness. Strong notes everywhere!I enjoy strong fragrances, but this is not a strong, well blended fragrance. This is the kind you'd expect to be worn to a clubbing scenario where quality is of no consequence.Do not blind buy a full bottle. I don't care who tells you this is as beautiful as the rose of Sharon, do not blind buy a full bottle. Obtain a sample first!I will pretend like the original Good Girl Blush is the only iteration that exists. Perhaps CH will try again and do better with the next one. That's all."

That’s the nauseating effect produced by this fragrance composition.Unfortunately the good girl you knew is not the good girl she used to be, she is losing herself and becomes annoying, she tells hundred promises but never follows it, she doesn’t let people speak, she jeopardizes everything.She is confusing with her hundreds personalities.

The name elixir is very fitting. It's literally the elixir of GG blush: deeper, stronger. In the OG GG Blush, the opening/mid notes stay for longer, but they are sharper. In the Elixir, the opening is much creamier and the fragrance evolves quickly, but stays creamy. Best suited for spring and autumn, as the patchouli makes it cloying in the heat. I own this one and I was debating whether to buy GG Blush too, but after sampling GG Blush I decided they are too similar to own both. If you have GG Blush, only buy Blush Elixir if you want a sexier, creamier version or enormous lasting power. And if you have Blush Elixir, there's no need to own GG Blush too."

I was waiting to love a GG, and now I do.This is BEAUTIFUL. The opening is nice and fresh, but even before drying down thar TONKA DUDE is so PLUSHY. It reveals the trajectory of this perfume journey immediately, you can just *feel* that it will settle into a gorgeously soft, musky, almost poofy drydown and it absolutely does. It's annoying that tonka isn't listed here, because it is with in-store descriptions and it definitely smells like tonka.Everything is really balanced here, and unlike other GG frags, I find that this one smells much better and less sharp at close range. I do love other GGs including the original, but I enjoy their scent trail much more than them on my person.This version is so smooth though, that it's easily just as nice to press your nose into as it is from a distance. The florals are very nice, and it doesn't smell like realistic ylang ylang, but there is a sunny quality to it. But it's a little sensual...like evening sunlight or the golden hour.I'm surprised and impressed by this release! 🌹🌄"

I honestly might consider purchasing this one once I get to know it better (I'm a big fan on the GG line, but not the OG). However, I SWEAR I have smelled this before, somewhere in the amber vanilla world.

Elixir is perhaps slightly more elevated and some might say a bit more ""sultry"" but it sort of lacks that same airy brightness that made me fall in love with Blush in the first place. You could say Elixir is more earthy whereas Blush is more airy.I will say though, the performance and projection is even better on this one and is definitely more intense and amped-up.

I’m glad I only bought the travel spray of the Elixir. I already have a 50 ml bottle + a 7 ml dabber of Good Girl Blush, and I don’t feel like the Elixir is different enough to warrant adding another full bottle to my collection. I say this as someone who owns all of them, though. If you don’t already have GGB, I can definitely see this being a signature scent/full-bottle worthy. I do think it’s another crowd-pleaser.So, what does it actually smell like then? Well, as I said, basically the same as GGB except for a couple different top notes. Initial spray is definitely darker and more mysterious, maybe a little sharper than GGB? But it dissipates into the same floral/vanilla drydown you get from the original. Lasting power is about the same as GGB as well, about 5-6 hours. And all the Good Girl fragrances have a nice sillage, in my experience - they leave a nice little scent trail and I can still easily smell them on me many hours after application. (Good for days when you can’t or don’t want to reapply!)Anyway, the Elixir is a more “nighttime” version of GGB, but I think it can be worn during the day as well, as it’s not overly dark/heavy/rich, in my opinion. I can also see wearing GGB during the day and then switching to this for an evening out."

While I really love the scent and think it is a beautiful blend I can't help but feel it is overpriced for how it performs. After smelling instore and getting a sampler I decided I wanted the bottle. The bottle is beautiful and the scent is luxurious however, I can't help but feel this doesn't perform on skin up to the $170 price point. I don't think it lasts very long on my skin or clothes. With multiple sprays at 8AM i will only pick up very slight hints of the scent by 12PM.The notes I pick up are fresh yellow floral and cashmere. There is also a recognizable vanilla and patchouli as well. The rose is only detectable after the scent has melted with your skin for a while.This is a nice perfume I just wouldn't pay more than maybe $100 for it if I had it to do over again."

Perhaps the older sister but not mother. The OG is playful, silly and cute. The notes in here are more refined and put together in a cohesive way. Blush Elixir is still playful and fun as the original but she’s older and ovulating lol. I don’t get much of the rose or patchouli. If anything I get a creamy tropical vibe. It’s almost like you took blush OG and added a pina colada. The original has a bit more freshness. Blush is my favorite out of the whole line so these two are very good to me and are different enough to have both.Someone below said it smells like a refined yara and I agree. It has the same creamy tropical scent to it.It’s going to be a beautiful scent for the summer evenings coming up."

Then I really didn't like the middle stage, even though I normally like ylang-ylang. Then the dry down was identical to Blush. I do like every stage of Blush, so I would choose it over Elixir. Sillage and longevity are both really good."

When I tried the elixir I loved it. Has a more powerful punch than the original but not crazy. The rose note and the y lang note is beautiful together

But has original DNA. It definitely is powdery. They all kind of smell the same lol but it's still a bit different. For the bottle, I'd get it anyway. Lasts about 6 to 8 hours. Longer on the clothes.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Carolina-Herrera/Good-Girl-Blush-Elixir-Eau-de-Parfum-88937.html,Good Girl Blush Elixir Eau de Parfum Carolina Herrera perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Immediate reaction is super positive and with the original Blush already being one of my favorites I definitely still get the original DNA but the note breakdowns don’t do justice the difference I’m smelling between them. The original incredibly fun and clean, playful, bright, this Elixir more bold, with more body and an interesting richness and sweetness contrasting with the original’s DNA in the overall structure. Both are incredible but imo it comes down to individual preference, if you enjoy more clean and lush profiles the OG Blush is superior, but the Elixir is better for those who prefer more layered and characteristic profiles especially with the amped up patchouli in the base."

I hate to see new frags rated to hell when they’re not fully released yet. Many people count on this website for help choosing a fragrance, and I think it’s important to be honest because I love our community and love that we all have different opinions/tastes/experiences with fragrance. I know people are somewhat tired of the CH GG flankers, but I am still in love with pretty much all of them and I know I’m not the only one.

The name elixir is very fitting. It's literally the elixir of GG blush: deeper, stronger. In the OG GG Blush, the opening/mid notes stay for longer, but they are sharper. In the Elixir, the opening is much creamier and the fragrance evolves quickly, but stays creamy. Best suited for spring and autumn, as the patchouli makes it cloying in the heat. I own this one and I was debating whether to buy GG Blush too, but after sampling GG Blush I decided they are too similar to own both. If you have GG Blush, only buy Blush Elixir if you want a sexier, creamier version or enormous lasting power. And if you have Blush Elixir, there's no need to own GG Blush too."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Carolina-Herrera/Good-Girl-Blush-Elixir-Eau-de-Parfum-88937.html,Good Girl Blush Elixir Eau de Parfum Carolina Herrera perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It smells about 90% similar to the original but it's a bit heavier and more potent in comparison. I'd consider it to basically be the night time version whereas the original is more for daytime wear. With that said, I still prefer the original as it has an ""airier"" quality to it that feels more vibrant and youthful. Elixir is perhaps slightly more elevated and some might say a bit more ""sultry"" but it sort of lacks that same airy brightness that made me fall in love with Blush in the first place. You could say Elixir is more earthy whereas Blush is more airy.I will say though, the performance and projection is even better on this one and is definitely more intense and amped-up. Overall, incredibly similar just a bit heavier and more ""punchy."""
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Carolina-Herrera/Good-Girl-Blush-Elixir-Eau-de-Parfum-88937.html,Good Girl Blush Elixir Eau de Parfum Carolina Herrera perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This got my friend and I compliments from complete strangers! Creamy, woody vanilla and ylang ylang. Not too dense, I struggle with a vanilla note that is too strong, I really loved the balance in this perfume. (Risks getting cloying in warmer weather.) The mandarin opening was a pleasant, refreshing start that disappeared within minutes. Patchouli follows a little deeper, in the beginning it’s not very noticeable however gets stronger overtime. The next morning (12+ hours on skin) the woody notes and the patchouli were still prominent. The stranger that complimented described it as “clean but complex.”Woody vanilla is always alluring to me, and I love the projection of this perfume. Once it develops it keeps a consistent performance for a very long time. Rather hard to come by these days! I’ve personally had the experience of not being able to smell the Good Girl line on my skin except for Very Good Girl Glam and this one.On me the sillage was fantastic for about 5 hours and then it turned into a detectable, rather strong skin scent. On my friend it projected for 6+ hours.I’ve also tried the original Good Girl Blush, they aren’t the same. On me GGB had an animalic punch that doesn’t work well with my skin and lasted very little so we were incompatible, although I loved it on the tester strip. Elixir is the stronger, more potent and more unique version of GGB. (Doesn’t smell too similar to Montblanc Signature imo.) I’d say Elixir is less powdery, ylang ylang adds an interesting twist and contributes to the creaminess. It’s denser, doesn’t have an underlying fruity aspect accompanying it, GGB is more ethereal and put together than Elixir that is a bit more intoxicating."

I was waiting to love a GG, and now I do.This is BEAUTIFUL. The opening is nice and fresh, but even before drying down thar TONKA DUDE is so PLUSHY. It reveals the trajectory of this perfume journey immediately, you can just *feel* that it will settle into a gorgeously soft, musky, almost poofy drydown and it absolutely does. It's annoying that tonka isn't listed here, because it is with in-store descriptions and it definitely smells like tonka.Everything is really balanced here, and unlike other GG frags, I find that this one smells much better and less sharp at close range. I do love other GGs including the original, but I enjoy their scent trail much more than them on my person.This version is so smooth though, that it's easily just as nice to press your nose into as it is from a distance. The florals are very nice, and it doesn't smell like realistic ylang ylang, but there is a sunny quality to it. But it's a little sensual...like evening sunlight or the golden hour.I'm surprised and impressed by this release! 🌹🌄"

I like it more than GG Blush since it's more original, the Blush is identical to Montblanc Signature to me, which I also own.

This has too much patchouli in it which ruins the softness and its innocence.The term 'Blush' represents a shy, reserved girl. She wouldn't wear such a strong patchouli scent.This flanker doesn't match any of the other flankers either. This might be the strongest flanker of the entire GG line only because of the heavy patchouli. Okay so take Mademoiselle + Blush = that's the smell.100% agree with szania.

It's a pretty basic fragrance, a floral-musky vanilla. But I am content with it, as I was looking for an everyday scent that's not so loud. That being said, this is quite a sweet fragrance. The most prominent notes for me are the musk, vanilla and star jasmine, then the amber and peony. I don't get the blood orange at all. Only bad thing is the longevity, it lasts about 3-4 hours on me and I have to reapply. Overall I'd give it a solid 8/10 :)"

I have no clue why powdery is listed as the top accord. The star jasmine is sickly sweet and the blood orange is super syrupy, it’s just too overwhelming. Cosmic reminded me of something I’ve smelled countless times before, like in B&BW products and other cheap body sprays yet at the same time it smells like something an older lady would wear. On top of that, the notes feel off and not well-blended. Despite vanilla being high on the note pyramid, I can’t pick it up at all. The fragrance is punchy and bold, I will give it that. My younger sister has been wearing it often since she got it, and I can smell it from across the room when we’re together, so the sillage is impressive. I was hoping for something unique based on the bottle and name, but unfortunately, it didn’t live up to my expectations. I just don’t think amber florals are for me."

It is easy to wear everyday to work because it is so basic. Smells clean, sweet and inoffensive. Smells like sooo many other fragrances. Not amazing.

But it is very light to begin with. This is a vanilla lovers good intro into musk or skin scents. It is the definition of pretty girl scent! Nothing is screechy or over powering. Very good blend!

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Sadly just sharp florals on me. I don’t really get any vanilla, amber, or cedar, just jasmine, peony, and musk with a hint of blood orange. It has minimal sillage and lasts about 6 hours. In terms of perfumes listed as similar—❌ Ariana’s Moonlight: also very floral on me, but has more fruitiness❌ Aquolina Pink Sugar: sweeter and not floral❌ Prada Paradoxe: sweeter and the florals aren’t as sharp"

I FREAKING LOVE THIS! It's so soft and fluffy and ethereal. I get a literal seratonin BLAST when I wear this. I didn't think I'd end up loving this as much as I do, but I cannot get enough.I don't typically go for celebrity frags, and I especially stayed away from this one because of all the bad things I heard. I finally just sprayed it on skin one day in Ulta and it knocked my socks off.Yes, it's simple. It's not complex. It's beautiful, has decent longevity, and creates a scent bubble that is quite profound. I don't see how anyone could be offended by this scent. It's creamy but not thick. It's sweet but not cloying. It's powdery but not mature. It's just perfect."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I hate most designer and celebrity perfumes and usually gravitate towards more woody niche “masculine scents”. The opening of this is pretty bad, super generic, cheap. Nothing special. However, on my skin, for the many many hours that it lingers (which is a shock since things don’t last long on me) it turns into the most addicting hard-to-pin-point attractive smell. It smells like a rich typically hot woman (kylie) who just naturally smells good, thanks to her fancy laundry detergent and hair products. It’s warm, ambery, musky with a hint of woodiness. It is the most accurate depiction of what I imagine Kylie smelling like. It’s new money type rich, so it’s not artisanal, but it’s likeable, yet it for sure smells quite elegant and well blended. After the first 20 minutes, I literally can’t describe what it smells like. It’s just the scent of Kylie who’s just been with her kids on a Sunday and is picking you up in her jeep."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Let me start by saying I'm no fan of these celebrities BUT credit where it's due, this is amazing. It smells like walking into a fragrance shop or the beauty department of the airport, like 10 different fragrance all mixed together but it works so well. It's so pleasant, I don't see how you couldn't at least like this. It's nothing out of this world, but it's really good! I got the 100ml bottle blind & I'm glad I did.Update, lasting power is pretty bad. On skin for me personally just over an hour & it's pretty much gone, clothes still smell nice but skin is barely there.."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is probably one of the most versatile ones in my collection. I sprayed this in Ulta and really liked it, so I bought the 100 ml right away, it's in the same price range as the AG perfumes, so pretty inexpensive. It's sweet but not too sweet. A little vanilla, a little wood, a little floral. It's nothing out of this world (cosmic, lol, sorry), but I feel like I can wear it anywhere, work, school, weddings, dates, etc. It lasts pretty long on clothes, on skin not as much. Overall, this is a safe gift to give to a daughter or a friend. It's a pretty scent and not offensive at all."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This does not smell like a well blended perfume. This has some kind of weak cupcake aroma. Maybe they should have put a bit more ambition and talent to create this ""Cosmic"". The bottle shape is clumsy and cheap looking.Also way overpriced here in Northern Europe, considering the product has no soul and no body either."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Personally I really like this perfume, it’s inoffensive, would be great as an office fragrance but yeah projection/longevity isn’t the best.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,After reading the reviews I thought I'd give this a go. Unfortunately I don't like it. It is sweet and warmish but it just smells common. Like every other cheapish scent out there. I thought it would be a bit different but it's not. It's a bit like furniture polish. I find it quite strong and a bit sickly.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a great feminine and bright fragrance. It's what pops in my head when I think of basic feminine scents. On the opening I get more amber and citrus than anything, and it eventually dries down warmer and muskier as described. Not a fan of florals so this surprised me in a good way as this is not very floral scented. I don't normally enjoy most celeb scents (I think Ariana Grande's is the only line I actually can get behind) however this is something I'll be reaching for often during the spring/summer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"When I first tried this in store, I sprayed it on paper, and I could barely smell anything at all. I sprayed it on my skin, and it was so much stronger. On first spray, it smelled a little dusty, but after about 20 minutes, that goes away and it gets sweeter and richer. It kind of reminds me of Prada Paradoxe/Born in Roma, but lighter. Its like a woody cotton candy scent. I am actually happy with the price of this, its a really good value.I dont think the bottle looks ""cheap"", as a matter of fact, it costs more to make custom molds for perfume bottles, which is exactly what Kylie did with this one. The lid is also super heavy.I could see this being a decently priced staple in my collection. It also has some sentimental value to it because my sweet fiancee bought it for me as a little treat."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I cannot tell anything about this perfume because I cannot smell it. I spray it and I cant detect ANY scent on my skin! I an shocked about it.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Love this one. It’s light enough to wear to work, but I can also overspray and get the scent bubble I want (I usually do this). I noticed if I apply it normally once and then re-apply about an hour later, the scent will last all day for me. It’s fresh and clean but sexy and warm at the same time. Very girly and pretty. Soft and sweet. Just lovely. I don’t even care for the KarJenners or associate this fragrance with them. No hate, I just don’t let them affect my feelings on this scent. This scent is beautiful!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,I actually really enjoyed this. Non-offensive feminine scent. I enjoy the vanilla/blood orange notes but the cedar comes through the most for me. It does more for me than the usual celeb scent. I definitely enjoy my travel size but likely won't repurchase. Nothing special in my opinion but great longevity for the price point.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"i love this one! i feel like a lot of the hate comes from karjenner haters, on this fragrance alone i can see similarities to la vie est belle, flower bomb, born in roma, however they are no dupes! not too sure on longetivity on myself as i go nose blind very quickly but reapplying for the price cant hurt. I feel like this is a safe blind buy if you enjoy feminine sweet perfumes."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I don't really like very strong musky perfumes, but if it has musk as a base note, it's usually quite a weak musk scent. Then I am able to enjoy the perfume anyway.Thats why i bought this one. But the musk in this perfume should definetly be on the top notes! This is a very very strong musk perfume.I do really like the dry down of this perfume tho!I wish i liked musky pefumes bc its actually a very good perume, but the musk is just to strong for me.I really like the combo of vanilla and blood orange."

Feel she missed the opportunity for Kosmic, know these girls love their K branding lol.. but the scent and cute simple bottle are quite noice."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I bought this upon release because it was cheaper than regular perfumes (prices have gone up!). Not knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised. I reach for this a lot and the atomizer is my favorite type! I cannot figure out what this smells like at all and I can't really distinguish the notes but I enjoy wearing it. I've receieved compliments several times along the lines of, 'who smells so good?' and it was this. Lasts plenty on skin and longer on clothes. I layered this with NR Nude Musc and I love that blend right now."

Would not buy it but I think it’s fun"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Ok so I bought a load of samples and this was included as a free one! The scoff I scoffed thinking ew - Kylie Jenner,(sorry any fans present but I really would rather not support that family in any way) this is going to smell like cheap ass and I nearly didn't even bother spraying it.Lord alive how wrong I was. I just happen to love this. the opening is screechy for like a second to my nose then immediately I get amber and vanilla musky goodness. I didnt have any problems with the sillage or longevity and after 8 hours I could still smell this on my wrist - and since its not that pricey a few top up sprays thoughout the day shouldnt be an issue.I still would prefer not to support their Klan in any way but ya know I might have to grab a small bottle of this cos in this round of samples it beat an Amouage, a Mancera, a Burberry and a Mugler in the rankings and out performed them longevity wise too!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"She smells like a perfume house trying to dupe Prada Paradox which I think she nailed it. However, the projection and longevity are not nearly as good. The smell faded pretty quick on my skin. I bought the 1 ounce, and have already used about half, I don't think I'll repurchase, but I will finish the bottle up! I can live without it, but I'm glad I tried it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It is pretty but basic - very repetitive floral, musky, slightly sweet feminine scent. I like Kylie but she should have been bolder!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I cannot believe that people write that it’s light and crowd pleasing! I sprayed it on my wrist, and got nothing but a very heavy headache inducing amber.Sure, it’s an ambery perfume, but amber can also be soft and pleasant, even though I’m not an amber person.But THIS was VERY strong! I ran to the bathroom to wash this off and still could smell it on me for the rest of the day:’(Since it’s so warm and AMBERY it might work for some as a winter scent:) But If you’re sensitive to strong scents and dislike amber in general - this is not for you."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"A bit sweeter than the notes or the pyramid would suggest. Incredibly familiar, yet not a dupe of anything I can think of. For better or worse, very very ""modern"". Maybe the idea was to take 4 of 5 of the best selling perfumes and combine them? There's a prompt for AI lol (ugh). Despite the ad copy, this isn't going to automatically make you think ""floral"", especially for floral lovers. I don't know what it takes to make a ""warm floral"" modern, but it sure seems to be to take out as much floral as possible. Short story - it's pleasant, likeable, but free of personality. At least the bottle is nice for those that like modern decor.I get 3 hours out of it at least. For the price point, it isn't terrible."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This has to be the weakest fragrance I've ever smelled. You can't smell shit even by burying your nose to your arm. I'm hesitant to call this even scented water, let alone a fragrance. It's also not just me; I've had the same exact reaction from my F&F who have tried this. You can totally forget about anyone else having even the slightest chance at detecting that you're wearing a perfume.I would comment on the scent profile if there was one."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Super pretty light scent. Not too musky, not too sweet just the right balance. Very easy on the nose and crowd pleasing. Creamy, airy with a touch of warmth, great for chilly days or evening. The longevity is not bad, but no projection to it. Perfect for close encounters!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Unexpected.I don’t have many fragrances on my shelf that aren’t niche anymore. I just can’t stand synthetic notes and I can tend to smell them in most designer fragrances. This though, completely unexpected. I have walked past this perfume a dozen times without a second thought of smelling it, knowing I wouldn’t like it, but something stopped me yesterday. I sprayed it on the back of my hand while walking through Ulta and I couldn’t stop putting my hand to my nose. It’s comforting. There is something so familiar about this that I quite literally can’t stop thinking about it. It envelopes me and takes me somewhere, wrapped in memories. Throughout the performance, it becomes lighter, softer but so present. It’s only been 24 hours since I’ve purchased this, but I can’t stop wearing it. I don’t want to stop wearing it. I want to smell this all the time. I’m on my way to pick up a bigger bottle as I know I am going to blow through 1oz of this quickly. Another thing to note is how beautiful the atomizer is, it is soft but perfect. Hah, I just can’t believe this perfume has jumped up to be in the top 5 perfumes I own."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is definitely a crowd pleasing Fragrance!!I haven't met a single person who dislikes this. ( At least the people I know ) And I can tell why . It's light and clean nothing ground breaking or something outstanding, but I really like to wear this as an every day kind of scent . It lasted about two hours on my skin so I had to reapply it several times throughout the day to last on me. So if you are looking for a niceclean ambery every day scent then this is definitely a great option."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Reminds me of my ex. It's like i've been wearing his hoodie for a week and can still slighty smell his cologne, but it's also mixed with my perfume. Love at first sniff. Haven't bought it yet, but i go to Douglas to use a tester every time it's nearby because the scent doesn't leave my head for a second."

Great base for any other perfume if you’re looking for stronger. Very amber forward but the florals and citrus really mellows it down. Very light and pretty scent. If you only have a couple perfumes in your collection, I don’t think you can go wrong with having this one."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It's a non-offensive work office scent. Nothing groundbreaking, but pleasant. When I first saw the notes, I expected it to remind me of Chloe, but they smell nothing alike. The peony was in the forefront and took just a couple minutes to dry down completely. I layered it with my Coco Paradise B&BW body mist and Chloe body oil from Brown Sugar Babe & there was an ok projection.This is definitely overspray friendly!! Don't be afraid to drench yourself in it.Although I like it, I definitely will try to find something similar for cheaper."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Not what I expected when I found out Kylie Jenner was releasing a new perfume, but I really like it! Pleasantly surprised by this.I do think it is very generic smelling, however, but it is so beautifully flattering and citrusy with a warm dry down. I do understanding the similarity to Good Girl and the fact this isn't revolutionary for a fragrance launch. Yet, given its price point, I do think it is a bad scent at all!Out of all the celebrity fragrances I have smelt, this is actually one of the better ones that feel less juvenile and more versatile to me! Definitely interested in trying this scent again."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"In all honesty, I'm choosing to approach this perfume with an open mind, disregarding any negativity surrounding either the perfume or its celebrity association, and instead, evaluating it purely as a perfume enthusiast. My encounters with this fragrance at Ulta left me intrigued. Upon my first try, I found it quite pleasant, but it was the second experience that truly captivated me, allowing me to enjoy its notes.What sets this scent apart is its uniqueness, coupled with an exquisite bottle design that adds to its allure. It seamlessly blends amber and floral notes, resulting in a comforting experience. After a while, the warm and inviting aroma, reminiscent of vanilla and musk, evokes a sense of coziness, almost like a second skin.One of its standout features is its moderate longevity, given my sensitivity to overpowering scents. While some fragrances tend to linger excessively and trigger headaches, this strikes a perfect balance, fading gracefully throughout the day without overwhelming the senses.During my recent visit, torn between CH Good Girl and Cosmic, I ultimately opted for the CH due to its sweeter profile and lighter amber notes. Yet, my thoughts kept drifting back to Cosmic, it was unforgettable. Rest assured, once I've accumulated enough points, I will definitely purchase the 3.3 ounces."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Unfortunately, to me it did smell like Good Girl flanker.

It’s a light, sweet, safe choice for the autumn and winter, a little too syrupy for spring or summer IMO. Minimal sillage and lasting power, I have to carry the bottle with me throughout the day"

I tend to go for nostalgia, or candy gormand perfumes which aren’t far different from old school celeb perfumes. But this perfume smells EXPENSIVE! I wouldn’t think twice if I smelt this in harrods at a high end counter.I’m so in love, it’s warm and sexy and mature, but in a nouveau rich way!"

It smells so pretty and clean.. what I would imagine Kylie would smell like. It's basic but the perfect single scent that one could layer with anything they desired. It has a lot of flexibility in that aspect. But I wouldn't buy it again as it isn't worth your money if it is just skin-smell after 30 minutes.. if not immediately.

It’s a nice fragrance with a fruity amber finish that has good longevity and medium silage. Like others have mentioned it feels like an Estée Lauder fragrance or a Victoria’s Secret fragrance because it’s pleasant, floral and fruit with an amber base and not overly sweet-there is a maturity to it. There’s a light spicyness from the peony which gives it a little bit of a twist but besides that it’s pretty linear. Definitely not a safe blind by because the opening of this is sharper with floral and citrus notes but the dry down is pretty and much softer than what you think you’re in for upon first spritz."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I tried this a few times with an open mind. I don’t like the Kardashian-Jenner clan but I do like fragrances so I gave it a shot. It’s not bad honestly, but I think it’s wayyyy overhyped.It reminds me of something from VS or Estée Lauder or something? Something in it is giving Y2K fragrance. It’s inoffensive I guess but boring. If you like it, it will probably be at TJ Maxx soon enough."

What did her create? Almost a copy of La vie est belle Legere, aka LVEB without patchouli and somehow lighter,fit to wear in summer. The notes don't really have anything to do with what you smell, amber, peony, orange don't even talk about that. The only merit of this product is that it can replace the discontinued LVEB Legere.What should I give them a note for? For what its he or for what does he imitate? Hmmm..."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This must be heavy in the synthetic aroma chemicals because I am almost completely anosmic to this. I smell something but it's not really identifiable as a perfume. It's like the far dry down of a fragrance, as if there aren't any top or middle notes, just a faint base of amber, some vanilla, and a touch of floral that I guess is the red peony. It isn't stinky by any means, which is good, but there is no body to this fragrance. My mom, who isn't into fragrances, tried it and she did say she got several compliments when she went out to her physical therapy session so it is appealing but it just doesn't quite do it for me. Too much is missing for me, but I'll give Kylie and her team an A for effort since it didn't make me gag lol."

I LOVE this, haha! I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and say this sucks and it's generic. Maybe I haven't smelled the fragrances people are referencing, because to me this smells so cozy, warm, and soft. It's my go-to comfort perfume. And not to mention the atomizer - it's not cheap at all, I love the slow pressing atomizer. I almost wish this wasn't by Kylie Jenner so I can openly say I love it hahaha.

Lets just start by saying, it's not a bad fragrance, its just unoriginal and definitely something I smelled before. It somewhat has an Estee Lauder DNA to it but can't really tell which perfume in particular. It's a total Good Girl by CH wannabe. Sheer and lightly floral. This perfume is very SIMPLE.. It didn't last long throughout the day, it does smell better at night, once it gets a little cooler. Will I ever buy it? No, no I won't, is it a pretty scent, (perhaps) I mean, it's not a bad scent. She could have launched it on her Kylie Skin, made it into a cute aesthetic BODY spray. Just saying. I think I would have liked it better. But definitely not worth buying. The bottle is FUGLY, there... I said it. There's nothing COSMIC about it. I'm just giving my honest review. BISOUS"

You can’t smell it after an hour, it becomes a skin scent very quickly, the projection is not good either.Overall, it’s a weaker or a sheer version of Good Girl. And it’s very similar to Vera Wang Princess."

A woody almost salty?? spicy gourmand. It's a nice scent but why not just get the original instead of supporting this family 🗑️. Cannot believe there are people who don't think it smells like GG! It's maybe a slight bit more citrus/fruity but within just a few minutes it dries down to an exact Good Girl dupe. If you want this bc you like GG and this is cheaper than GG do yourself a favor and get the Good Girl hair mist. It costs a little less than this and has monster strength, lasting power and silage. I got the GG hair mist and it's so strong I didn't even bother buying the perfume. It's a hair perfume but still way better quality than this."

First, I was able to smell it on a trenchcoat a few weeks after I sprayed the perfume on it. It also stayed on a jumper for days. Such a lovely surprise. If mixed with eos Vanilla Cashmere body lotion, the scent is glued to my skin forava… We must bear in mind that the intention was to create a skin scent and not a loud perfume nor a statement one. I think mission accomplished! It’s a head turner and people notice it: in particular women. It’s also one of the rare perfume I own where I can identify all the notes clearly or at least the following families: citrus, floral and amber. Anyway, it simply became one of my favourite perfumes of all time. So warm and sweet…I am simply addicted and use it on a daily basis despite my collection that is not small, in particular for bedtime. Thank you, Kylie, 🩷"

Lifehack: wrap a rubber band around the metal piece, it gives more grip to untwist it.the clear bottle looks a bit cheap, it looks like any off brand perfume dupe bottle... but that's just my personal opinion.The vaporiser sprays exceptionally nice, one spray will give u a very big and wide spritz.The smell is very nice, it's floral but not overpowering. A perfect balance between florals and a sweet girly vibe.It reminds me of a sweet flower nectar."

However, I kept smelling it on my hand where I sprayed it and on the tester, as the scent lingered on my clothes for DAYS so I gave up and ordered a bottle! The opening is really sweet and you kinda get overwhelmed by the cotton candy smell, but when it dries down, you get this really soft, pleasant, clean, girly scent. It has a distant hint of BR540 and Good Girl but on a more gentle, non-aggressive side. I can say that she is perfect on her own and quickly got into my top 5. The bottle is super cute as well."

I was so excited to try this because I love flowerbomb & La vie est belle, and hoped this would be a muskier take of those. I sprayed it and it wasn't strong at all so I forgot about it. A few hours later it started being very strong and I was sure that I'm smelling Good Girl (which I owned) only to smell my wrist and see that it's Cosmic's drydown (strong projection tho :). It's not bad but I don't wear Good Girl very well, and it just it. Ambery, sweet, a bit bubble-gummy, with some freshness that lightens it. It's cute and I do think the bottle is unique and doesn't look bad. I think it's only worth it if you really want IT, not because it's the best scent in it's category."

Not powdery enough for ""powdery"" to be listed on the top of the notes. Sweet but not too sweet. Musky but not too musky. I love perfumes that are heavy on cashmeere, vanilla and this cozy sweetness, at the same time combining them with musk (i looove musk). This is not it. It seems like a balanced perfume that tries a lot of things and suprisingly it succeeds. Different notes are meeting togheter to create this well blended mixture that smells as a ""whole"". Its nice.I expected coconut fragrance from ms. Jenner, tbh, but this one is a good one too. Its matchy to ariana grande perfumes but just a lil bit less sweet i think. That is the best description I could have given you guys."

Better than a lot of celebrity perfumes. The Beyonces and Rihannas and so on...all you get usually, are fruity florals, that fade very quickly...meh.This one is a safe buy and much better than your typical celeb perfume. Almost any age could wear this. Price point is reasonable. The bottle is REALLY GORGEOUS.

Comes across slightly synthetic at the beginning. I don't sense the blood orange.I see why some people are comparing this to Cloud.

Hasn't changed much since the beginning. A syrupy, amber pear floral. I like it. It's pleasant and sweet and I keep catching whiffs of it. While I like this, I don't know if it's special enough for me to buy. This also feels like a cooler weather scent to me. It's hard for me to want to wear syrupy scents in a tropical climate. But in Fall and Winter I'd love this with a cozy sweater.I like the look of the large bottle and how it feels in my hand but I'd never get through such a large bottle."

I wear it for occasions where I know I can't wear a heavy perfume. I don't get screechy or hairspray or spicy like other reviews for me this is a soft fluffy cloud.

This is a scent a lot of the Kardashians have worn because of Kris. However, these scents have absolutely nothing in common. Michael is a heavy warm tuberose scent. Maybe the warm floral musky aspect was her inspiration"

A true candied floral. It’s a designer type fragrance, not indie or niche and not something innovative but will definitely be a crowd pleaser. It reminded me of two scents right away, 212 Sexy Carolina, but without the pink pepper, and also reminded me of a modern youthful version of Bora Bora. Cosmic really did actually last a pretty long time on me; I wore it from about lunch time and I could still smell it on my inner elbow before my late night shower, not strong but still there."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The scent profile changes drastically over the first hour. On my skin, cosmic opens with a lovely fruity, white floral, musk scent. After 10 minutes, it transforms into a screechy and headache inducing white floral with musk. An hour later, it turns into a spicy, musky, white floral with pencil shavings. This is my favourite part of the fragrance and I enjoy the scent. I detect a bit of amber but I can’t smell the vanilla until three hours later. Overall it’s a very well blended fragrance that would be suitable to wear to the office.Kylie said that she was inspired by a perfume that her mother used to wear, and I definitely feel a vintage vibe from this because of the musk and white floral, but it’s appropriate for all ages. It is a unique fragrance and I can’t think of any other perfumes that smell similar to it. The Sillage is about an arms length and it’s a skin scent after an hour. It’s a beautiful fragrance, but since it turns screechy on me I don’t feel the need to purchase it. If you enjoy musky white florals it’s worth trying."

It progresses into a creamy floral and dries down to a subtle, vague vanilla with a SLIGHT, ever so slight musk. It smells youthful with a touch of maturity to it. I can see this working for the ages 20+. At most, this lasts about 3 hours but it is subtle, it doesn’t project much from the moment you spray to the dry down. This is very much a skin scent. Honestly, I can see this working for sexy times if your persons into the scent. You can overspray and get a scent bubble as with any other weak perfume or body mist. I don’t recommend this based off the fragrance profile itself and weak performance. It is a nice scent, but not the niche scent I’ve heard it described as."

There’s a beautiful blend of creamy amber and peony that I get in the first initial spray. I find this to be a beautiful, safe blind buy for anyone looking for a reasonably priced light, spring/summer scent.The sillage sucks, radiating only an arm’s length away, but its pricing is well worth adding a few more sprays in, without worrying about breaking the bank."

Tried it again later and have to say it is really pretty and I do like the scent of it a lot, wish it would last longer and wouldn't sit so close to the skin.

It's a light, fluffy, floral. The jasmine is not too heavy which is good because it's not my favorite note in general. The peony & vanilla make this PRETTY. The musk makes it slightly SEXY. I could see Kylie wearing this. I would consider it an everyday easy reach, not a statement maker. If you are anosmic to musk, this may be a challenge to smell."

It also is a light scent, not overwhelming which Kylie kinda marketed it as a “skin scent” so dont go into this thinking it’s a “beast mode” fragrance"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Kylie et al did well with this release. Inoffensive, light, musky, sweetened scent with mass appeal. Does that mean everyone will like it? Ofc not! But for what they seemed to set out to do I think this was well-achieved. Price point is nice, it's refillable, clean, and well-constructed. I will be adding it to my wish list."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a first and second impression review. I first smelled it in store and was so underwhelmed with it. The opening is so boring and I can barely smell it. I was happy I didn’t blind buy it. Fast forward to a few hours later I remembered I still had the tester paper in my pocket and thought I’d give it another sniff. Absolutely different smell! I loved it. I bought a bottle that same day. To me the opening could have been done better but fortunately it only lasts maybe 30 mins on skin. After that, there’s this almost medicinal accord (similar to Baccarat) which I don’t dislike, and the beauty of it is in the dry down. I’ve had it on for almost an hour and I now get the same vibe the paper tester had in the dry down. Is it exceptional ? No. But if you are looking for that great clean girl scent that doesn’t smell like toilet refresher, this is worth trying. In that same category I recommend CLEAN Skin over anything else, but I know some people don’t like praline and salt. If my opinion changes, I’ll update but so far I like it quite a lot."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I have to admit, I am not usually one for celebrity perfumes and I am very hard to please and sceptical about perfumes in general. I tried this in store just to pass the time expecting to hate it. And at first I wasn't impressed, it felt pretty generic. I tried a few other celebrity perfumes which to me smelt much more cheap and sickly than this, so I gave this one a go. As time went on I grew to love it. The dry down smells so good I kept sniffing my wrists and jumper all day long. The next morning my partner said how nice my 'hand' smelt as he was kissing it. I took a shower and missed having that smell on me. So much so, I bought it that day. The lingering smell is like a sweet but ambery, musky skin smell that I happen to love and find comforting.That said, it's not anything groundbreaking. It's something I would use as an everyday, douse my clothing with it to make sure I smell good, type of perfume. It's not something I would cherish and use sparingly, or wear to expect some kind of reaction or appear mysterious and well cultured. But those perfumes aren't always appropriate.Sillage is weak after a period of time, but I am not one for wanting to blast passers by with my scent. I could smell it on myself all day and into the next day which I wasn't expecting.All in all, I would say this is one of the better value perfumes and it's nice to own a perfume I am not precious about using but still love the smell of."

It's on a strip, and I keep sniffing it to figure it out.Know what it is?!........Everything lately. This quite literally smells like EVERYTHING released these days. Yes, it smells like Good Girl. Yes, it smells like the celeb perfumes people compare it to. Yes, it smells like a LVEB flanker (but lighter). Yes, the opening smells like Chance Eau Tendre.If anything I listed clangs any bells for you and you enjoy them, then maybe check this out. However, I can't believe people compare it to Sensual Amber, it doesn't smell like that to me at all and I'm almost insulted. Sensual Amber is one of my longstanding favorite cheapies 😂🥰 SA is richer, less laundry-ish and has a distinct orange softness.This isn't bad, but it's boring to me. I hate being *that* person, but it truly doesn't stand out whatsoever and it's not memorable at this point.It's a little white floral-y, combined with a soft neo-amber and clean laundry musk. That's about it."

A solid no due to the stinky musk, similar to what’s in Commodity Milk expressive and not a perfume superdose. Is it that cheap ambroxan smell? It’s stomach churning.Not saying it smells just like milk expressive or superdose , but it has a similar off putting scent. Smells like body odor, bad body odor I never want to smell. Like someone with gross smelling sweat. Wish they’d done something original instead of going skin scent stink fest. Nothing like Good Girl, the 3 people who said that need to have sinus surgeries. Also I like Kylie makeup so I had high hopes. This is disgusting y’all."

Not what I expected, I thought it was going to be SUPER generic but it isn’t. Got it when I was looking for a scent with amber in it. This is nice! It’s a lightly sweet/amber/ bit of fresh scent. Once it’s dried down, it’s like a skin scent but a skin scent that projects. When my arm sways by my face, I get a pleasant whiff of the perfume. I’m glad I got it for my bday. I got the big bottle, it’ll last me a while since I have about 30 fragrances. I’m very satisfied."

When I smelled it on paper, I immediately grabbed it because I was like wowww this is freaking gorgeous!! They only had a 3.4oz so I grabbed it & I am not disappointed in that decision.Today I opened it & sprayed it to show my bestie & realized it smells like Good Girl by CH (in-store it smelled different to me)! Shockingly I hate GG, but this smells softer, a little more floral forward than GG. Reminds me more of GG Supreme without the tuberose/creamy milky scent it gives. This might be my go to office fragrance after wearing Lattafa Yara & PDM Oriana for weeks now lol!Very well done to Kylie! This is a beautiful fragrance"

Mod Vanilla but less sweet. This is a truly addictive scent. I can't stop over spraying for a week and already ordered the refill. It is an easy perfume but so …so …pleasant. A versatile scent, and it is true that the bottle fits nicely into any hand.I've yet to test to determine the sillage and true lasting power, but I like it with no doubt.EDIT: Performance could be better unless I use a VERY rich body cream like Aquaphor from Eucerin/Cerave/Eos. Slightly better performance on clothes tho."

I has a prominent sewwt amber, very reminiscent of Sensual Amber from Bath and Body Works. This also has an airyness like Ariana Grande fragrances, maybe something like Moonlight with its creaminess.The bottle is very weighted and nice, plus the atomizer is amazing. It sprays very nicely and quite worth the money in my opinion.(Can't speak on longevity or projection yet since I haven't had it long enough)"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"To my nose it has a fizzy citrus and its almost effervescent at the top - it’s addicting! It’s light, sweet, and fizzy. I’m still unsure of the dry down..sometimes I get a stinky cheap amber and other times it’s quite enjoyable.The bottle is nice and heavy, the cap feels expensive when removing it, and that atomizer is ahhmazing!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I tried this in Ulta. My take on the amorphous shaped bottle is that it is not stunning but appealing to look at and feel. I'm pleased that the decision was made to avoid naming it Kosmic. Perhaps the marketers thought the K clan association might cause some ambivalence and stray from the concept of it being other worldly.TL;DR - My initial response was of ""this reminds me of something,"" but I couldn't immediately determine what perfume(s) I have or have tried are similar to me. Then I thought of Eclat d’Arpège Lanvin but without the purple flowers. Is it a vibe like VS Tease without apple & pear, Signature Montblanc minus magnolia, Burberry Her without berry fruit, diluted BR540? From there I determined, by studying notes on Fragrantica, this could be Stella Stella McCartney, Izia Sisley or Versace Bright Crystal sans rose. I'm guilty of overthinking. I determined one could add, subtract or substitute one or two notes to almost any popular light pink fragrance and arrive at something similar to this. Examples: Add peony to Paradoxe and Valentino BIR (and maybe remove the currant & pepper). Replace the berries with citrus in L'Imperatrice D&G. My thought process has flaws, I wasn't accounting for nuance, a huge factor in the universe of fragrance. Perhaps Cosmic is unique. Yes, fragrances have similar properties that evoke feelings and memories. But I can't conclude ""well, this is exactly this with or without jasmine, or whatever."" It's not just about the formula. This strengthens the reason why personal affinity for certain notes and accords, along with moods and seasonal preferences allows for so many fragrances to exist and be enjoyed. Maybe I should try to experience new test perfumes by letting them ""be"" and ignoring the urge to dissect them right of the bat. I guess this was a re-learning curve experience for me.I think Cosmic is wearable in a non-offensive, intimate way. I'm predictable, I often end my reviews by indicating, as I am now. I would consider buying this after using up many other perfumes I have."

I’d have to say it’s the perfect every day scent. The sweet floral notes are balanced so well by powdery amber and a musky vanilla base - can’t say I really pick up the cedarwood. I definitely detect the similarities to Flowerbomb and CH Good Girl - As I love those fragrances, it comes as no surprise that I enjoy this as well. I can’t exactly speak for longevity, but I see this being an easy reach for work, or to wear on a date with my boyfriend."

Like me personally, i am not the biggest fan of the kardashians BUT i am also not a kardashian hater. i just dont really care for them. But in my opinion, i really love this fragrance and it is beautiful to me. it smells like a very light floral, vanilla, powdery musky scent.

Im not a Kardashian ""hater"" (I dont want to hate ANY human being) Im just not a Kardashian fan. I think the bottle for Cosmic is SUPER eye catching when its photograped. I had no intentions of buying the fragrance no matter how it smelled but I still wanted to get my nose on it. The beautiful sales associate that greeted me at the front when I walked in, rolled her eyes and sd she hated the fragrance once I gave her the que we were kin folks by saying, ""Dont worry! Im ONLY testing. Im NOT buying."" In person the bottle wasnt AS dazzling but its still nice. I didn't put the fragrance on my skin. I started with the paper and it didn't deserve my skin. I do see where ppl say it has a similar dna to Carolina Herrera's Good Girl. I personally dont like the OG Good Girl despite it's popularity. Is it a dupe for GG? No! Are they close cousins...yes! Im sure the fragrance will do well. What did get my skin yesterday? Another try of YSL Over Red and Flowerbomb's Tiger Lily and Good Fortune Elixir, & Viva La Juicy Sucre All 4 of those are full bottle worthy. When I went to pick up the new Daisy Wild from Marc Jacobs the sales associate told me to put that mess down lol. 💚 Green Stravaganza from Valentino was another no. Green juice just was NOT working for me. No one is talking about Escada Brisa Cubana. On paper it reminded me of Kayali. Sweet, light, cute, elevated body sprayish. 😍 It does deserve at least a skin test next time I stop in!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Cosmic is, as I expected, a generic sweet scent, youthful and feminine. The bottle looks and feels cheap, but the scent isn't as bad as I'd expected. Made with mass appeal in mind, Cosmic is reminiscent of many other scents, a vanilla-sweetened floral.I get a strong orange blossom note at initial spray, but given the listed notes, an orange-jasmine accord could realistically give this effect. The orange isn't juicy; instead, it is syrupy and slightly tropical - like orange blossom. Orange blossom is almost ubiquitous in modern sweet feminine scents, so a similar accord here comes as no surprise.The orange subsides early on, with the clean jasmine note becoming dominant, lingering throughout. Vanilla follows closely, keeping everything sweet. It becomes powdery as it develops, with some surprisingly animalic muskiness creeping in as it dries down, giving an amber effect to the base. It wears thin here, becoming somewhat harsh and synthetic. Sillage and longevity are moderate, and it is a transeasonal day scent.A generic sweet, musky floral, Cosmic is what I expected - utterly unmemorable. It isn't bad until it runs out of steam at the drydown phase, but there are many superior versions of this scent profile on the market. 2/5."

It’s so odd. It smells like a bunch of mashed up popular warmish perfumes mixed in a 1:10 ratio with water. I’m so confused. It’s not even as strong as some of my body sprays. I do like the bottle, and sprayer is very high quality. I purchased straight from the website, so I know it’s real.

Cosmic isn’t a bad scent, it’s just generic and meh. It opens rather screechy and amber/jasmine heavy, which can be too much for some. It dries down to a Good Girl wannabe. If you have Good Girl, there’s no need to have Cosmic. Still can detect slight sharp screechiness on skin after an hour of wear."

But it's still really pretty and wearable for the office, running errands, girls & date night.@smile4thecamera said it best; it's like wearing an angora sweater. Very feminine, cozy and soft, and I feel sexy in this.Sileage is moderate, I sprayed it in my office, and someone across the office could smell me and asked if I'm trying to impress him, ummm... no (-__-).Initially, you have a nice cloud around you, but then sits close to the skin after about two hours."

I had higher hopes, I was expecting Ariana Grande style smell, the cosmic bottle made me think of something molecular like or more unique, but no, just another duty free basic amber vanilla, meh. Not bad just mehEdit: why the fuck are baccarat and cloud on the reminds me of section? Absolutely NOT"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is a basic warm amber, vanilla, musk. The opening notes are almost non-existent to me (moreso the blood orange), but that okay it's still very nice. I was expecting to not like this but after a few days I can't stop wearing it. Cosmic is a very comforting scent"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I couldn’t wait to get to Ulta and test this out. It’s absolutely stunning! I seriously don’t understand the “reminds me of” list because this doesn’t compare to anything listed imo. This is a gorgeous sweet, rich amber and jasmine with a touch of musk. Light & fluffy. Out of the 100 + perfumes that I have my husband says this is the best smelling one I have. Projection is decent and lasts about 6-7 hours on me. I only bought the 1oz bottle but I’m definitely getting the bigger one once I use this one up. Great for all seasons, might be too heavy for summer days but good for night."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I liked this more than I thought I would. It's mostly a dense, sweet amber with the florals showing more after an hour or so. Longevity is surprisingly decent. I don't love the look of the bottle but it feels like quality, heavy glass and feels nice to handle. Not ground breaking but would be nice for someone looking for something easy, wearable."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Bottle is really beautiful and I agree with an article who stated that it looks like it's Elsa Peretti inspired. Cosmic is quite long-lasting and wafts nicely around you. Bit more than a skin scent IMHO. On me the scent changes quite a lot from opening to dry-down. Flowery (natural) sweet musk to smoky amber to babydoll-head vanilla musk (I also sense the ambroxan). No sweet sharpness like in Black Opium or LVEB. I also think less sprays is more with this one. Not sure Cosmic fits me personally but I think this is a nice and well thought-out first foray into the world of perfume for Kylie.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I came in with no expectations on this, and I'm rather indifferent about this family, so I didn't show up to these comments with bias in place. For what this is - which is a crowd-pleasing, mid-priced celebrity perfume - it's really nice. One of those easy to grab scents. Something I'd offer to a girlfriend who doesn't normally wear perfumes, because it's inoffensive and can be worn wherever, whenever. I have over a hundred perfumes to choose from on my shelves, and I can tell this will have no problem working its way into my rotation."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"It’s definitely a gourmand . Smells lactonic to me. There’s a similar note in Ariana Grande’s cloud and I don’t know what it is, but my body chemistry makes it smell like poo mixed with the other notes. All in all, not bad but definitely gourmand I got no floral and doesn’t work for all body types"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"The opening strongly remind me of a milder version of Olympea by Paco Rabbane mixed with Born in Roma by Valentino. The opening and mid smell a bit salty to me, probably because of the jasmin. It turns into a musky vanilla skin scent later on. It’s giving the vibes of somebody, who naturally smells nice without even trying. The projection is small but it lasts on clothes. I sprayed this on before going to bed and still smelled it in the morning. As somebody who has 80+ perfumes, i find it a nice addition to my collection and i think it stands on its own ground.I remember there was a thing going around years ago, that Kylie doesn’t like strong scents because they give her headaches. Comic is very much in line with that - it’s not a strong perfume, rather a soft and mild scent for everyday."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"At the beginning I detect dior-poison girl DNA- sweet marzipan-y almond with some juicy fruits. Then it’s slowly going into the good girl DNA and stays like that. Stays extremely long on my skin- sprayed at 6pm, getting whiffs of it til midnight and on the nxt morning it was still there but as a skin scent.I like it…it’s good- there’s nothing negative I can say about it. I can imagine all the guys loving this smell as it’s sweet, slightly fruity, cosy and very inviting"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Smells like a cross between Good Girl and FlowerBomb. Very very mass appealing and boring.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,This is very soft musky-ambery with a hint of vanilla fragrance. It doesn’t remind me of anything. It’s just a pretty non-offensive comforting fragrance. This is the type of scent that you can wear to bed or out and about. I don’t get the similarities to any of the fragrances others have mentioned. 🤷🏻♀️
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,It reminds me of flowerbomb without the patchouli. Really really nice. Love the bottle as well.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I would say I am a pretty big Kar-Jenner fan but have always felt that all perfumes done by either Kylie or Kim Kardashian smell very identical no matter what the fragrance is so I did not have high hopes for Cosmic. I prepared myself when I went to smell it at Ulta but WOW WAS I WRONG. This fragrance is a slam dunk. I would say this scent is very similar to Black Opium by YSL. As a male, I am very drawn to the scent and have already purchased a bottle to gift to a family member."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I have never expected a celebrity fragrance to be groundbreaking. We have had some true gems and award winners over time, and while these fragrances many times are well loved, to me, they often have one characteristic in common... easy reach, crowd pleaser. Some do this in a juvenile way, some in a more refined way, however, the golden ticket for a celebrity fragrance is to be mass appealing. This is where a little objectivity could do us fragrance aficionados some good... I'll review a work for what it is and try not have unrealistic expectations.ANYWAY, I really like Cosmic! This is a warm floral done well. It has sweetness and depth and is neither overly descript or nondescript. I do find the use of star jasmine as opposed to jasmine sambac or common jasmine to be perfect for creating a fragrance anyone could wear... I am averse to jasmine in fragrance, but star jasmine, which isn't truly jasmine, is known for it's lightness and sweetness. This note compliments blood orange well. The presentation of peony here is a simple fresh floral note that serves to add some lift to the star of this fragrance... warm amber.This fragrance projects well for the first 1-2 hours of wear, and leaves a pleasant scent trail. I won't read too much into the name, but cosmic seems to fit fine. It's seeing the first sparkling stars in a clear sky at dusk on a warm day... I will say we may have missed an opportunity here by not spelling this ""Kosmic""...but I digress.The bottle is much nicer in person than in pictures, bonus points to the team for making this refillable. Designed to look like art from another world and to also fit your hand... I don't know about the otherworldly art concept, but it does feel nice in the hand and is not awkward to hold and spray. By the way, I appreciate the pressurized atomizer on this.In all, Kylie and Nicole did a great job, especially for this to be their first fragrance. I hope they continue to work together and we get a solid line of scents. Welcome to the party, Kylie."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Nothing special. Smells like every generic crowd pleaser fragrance you can find at the perfume shop. Smells absolutely nothing like baccarat even though it has some similar notes. A disappointment
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I've come to really appreciate the scent of jasmine, so I really enjoy the clean accord here, that lasts throughout Cosmic's weartime. The gentle note of blood orange is very authentic and pairs with the jasmine very nicely. The peony is soft and difficult to separate from the jasmine and blood orange; it gives a hint of peppery spice & heat to the fragrance, but the jasmine is the only clear floral note in the fragrance.The amber and vanilla enveloped musk lend a undertone of coconing warmth and creaminess - sometimes I can pick up on a pinch of salted caramel. The cedarwood is slow to develop and remains really subtle on me.Cosmic wears for around the six to seven hour range on skin, not especially great but not terribly bad either - applied to clothing, I'll get occasional hints over 24 hours later. As it's described as being designed as something skin-like, I can't complain about it not having a large aura.Cosmic is extremely easy to wear for all ages & seasons and it is not irritating to other people; the fragrance is light, ageless, and has a understated appeal. I'm 40 and don't feel like mutton dressed as lamb - this is a perfume that I honestly do think will work for everyone. I most likely will buy a refill bottle when my original bottle is empty & the brand has a money-off offer or other tempting promotion on ‐ not only is it enjoyable on it's own, but it is also perfect for layering.Also; making the bottle refillable is both sustainable and cost-effective - if you purchased a 30ml or 50ml bottle originally, then a single refill bottle is large enough that it will last you between what 3 and 5 regular replacement bottles would have cost. Shaping the bottle to ensure that it easy & comfortable to grip is a really nice feature; many low-mid tier brands try to make their fragrances stand out from the crowd with eyecatching bottle designs, which are awkward & almost painful to hold and push the nozzle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Very pretty easy going scent. Loving that Kylie cosmetics is coming out with fragrance!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Reminds me of Calvin Klein eternity for women
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"cosmic is like the bubbly, teenybopper little sister of Valentino Donna Born in Roma. I have to say, i wasn't expecting much from Kylie, but she did her thing with this one. it's warm and comforting but just light enough for daily wear. to me, the jasmine is the star of the show; the amber and vanilla support it beautifully without overpowering it. it's no beast by any means, but it still lasts a decent 5 hours or so on clothes. $78 for 3.3oz is a great deal, too, especially with as many discounts are floating around online. I already own DBiR, so I won't purchase this for myself, but I think it's a great choice for a young teenager wanting a 'grown up' scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Versatile girly musky scent. Very nice on bloater, an ambroxan bomb on skin"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I loved this perfume at first sniff and bought a 50ml. After a few days I couldn’t shake the feeling that I know this smell. Went into my collection and realized it’s a weaker rendition of good girl mixed with Valentino Donna not a terrible scent at all but if you already own these this may be redundant and also less long lasting, at least on my skin. I sprayed them side by side and I ready couldn’t tell a major difference that was enough for me to keep my cosmic bottle. No hate I really do enjoy the fragrance and i can see this being a great choice for people who enjoy good girl but may need something softer/ maybe more appropriate for younger girls if good girl or Donna is too grown up for them! Overall it is a very versatile fragrance but good girl just is a bit more rounded and longer lasting for me personally!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Guy here. This stuff smells amazing honestly. The performance is subpar but the refill bottle is so cheap, it’s absolutely worth getting a travel sprayer to keep on you for the day.It kinda reminds me of a more juicy/floral Glossier You but it’s safe for guys to wear too imo. My gf loves it on me and her."

It’s so pretty and ethereal, reminding me of a bright day running through a field of flowers. It's soft, sweet, and floral—a pure, uplifting vibe. The fragrance is faint, more of a skin scent, perfect for those who prefer an intimate, delicate aroma rather than a potent one. While I adored this perfume, it's not very long-lasting and doesn't project heavily, making it ideal for close, personal moments."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"I love this perfume! I can’t imagine a better signature every day easy reach scent! I have never smelled a celebrity fragrance as elegant as this one. And I appreciate the price point because I feel like so many perfumes have become outrageously expensive. I appreciate this one for being just the right amount of sweet, vanilla, musky, and clean to wear for any time of day and any occasion. Now all this to say, I am just an average 34 year old woman, not a perfume connoisseur, and I am a stay at home mom so I don’t need my fragrances to make a statement or be anything but pleasant smelling every day scents. For the majority of people, I think Kylie hit the mark on a pretty and easy to wear scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,Not a fan of this one. Starts off smelling sweet like Vanilla Musk. As soon as the spray starts settling and drying down you get pure floral and then Grandma floral. If you like floral then you will like this one - if not then don't bother buying.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"This is not groundbreaking or out of this world, especially in its generic opening (which I hated). However, the wear of this scent is unarguably magnetic, soft, warm, fluffy, feminine and elegant. It’s a soft, sweet ambery musk, with a bit of jasmine and good dose of fluffy vanilla. It’s not gourmand vanilla, but a warm fluffy vanilla. It’s exactly what Kylie looks like she would smell like. This lasts over 8 hours on me, with a moderate sillage. I can smell hints of this on my self in the morning in my hair and clothes. So I’m very happy with its performance. (Normally things don’t last long on me)"

For people who are complaining that it’s not strong enough or too close to skin kind of projection… she literally says it in the description of the scent, it’s a “skin-inspired” scent.I take it for what it is, and I really like it!I think she did a great job!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Let me start by saying, the discourse online regarding this fragrance has been annoying. The reviews are either sponsored and saying it's the most amazing scent to ever exist, or people being salty and crying about not wanting to give billionaires more money (in which case I have devastating news about literally every other large corporation).Trying this and liking it has almost felt embarrassing.But, removing all that noise...It's nice. It opens with a juicy, fresh note to it. The notes list blood orange, but to me it has a plum-y vibe. The jasmine is prominent, followed by the vanilla which softens the brightness of the jasmine, rounding it out to become fluffy and a bit powdery. The dry down is pure amber and musk.The scent lasted all day, but it became fully a skin scent after two hours. When sprayed on clothes, I can still smell it the next day. It's not a loud scent and everyone in a room won't be able to smell you.I enjoy the price point and that the bottle is refillable. The bottle is also a weighty glass and the sprayer on it gives a very fine mist. Whether or not you like the bottle design is up to you, but the quality itself is good.What the perfume is not, is ground-breaking. It smells like many perfumes you've smelled before. But overall, it's lovely. I see it selling well and going into my personal daily rotation. I'm not opposed to celebrity fragrances or smelling ""basic"" if I like something. My personal tastes are simple.It could be redundant if you have a large perfume collection, so I'd encourage testing it before making a decision. If you're in the market for a slightly floral, vanilla/amber skin scent and don't want to spend a ton, give it a whirl.**After seeing the comparisons to Flowerbomb, I definitely get it... But respectfully, Flowerbomb is better. This doesn't have the magic of that tea note nor the longevity. But it's hovering right around the same vibe and costs significantly less. It's very pretty, especially if you're looking for something a bit more understated.*** The more I wore it, the deeper I fell in love with it. I have 40+ fragrances and this is the one I want to wear all the time. A real compliment getter as well. While it could be considered ""generic"" there's something here that's really special."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kylie-Cosmetics/Cosmic-Kylie-Jenner-90957.html,Cosmic Kylie Jenner Kylie Cosmetics perfume - a new fragrance for women 2024,"Ok, I feel like I'm going crazy with this one... considering how many people wrote this off as being boring and overdone. I FREAKING LOVE THIS! It's so soft and fluffy and ethereal. I get a literal seratonin BLAST when I wear this. I didn't think I'd end up loving this as much as I do, but I cannot get enough.I don't typically go for celebrity frags, and I especially stayed away from this one because of all the bad things I heard. I finally just sprayed it on skin one day in Ulta and it knocked my socks off.Yes, it's simple. It's not complex. It's beautiful, has decent longevity, and creates a scent bubble that is quite profound. I don't see how anyone could be offended by this scent. It's creamy but not thick. It's sweet but not cloying. It's powdery but not mature. It's just perfect."

It smells like walking into a fragrance shop or the beauty department of the airport, like 10 different fragrance all mixed together but it works so well. It's so pleasant, I don't see how you couldn't at least like this. It's nothing out of this world, but it's really good! I got the 100ml bottle blind & I'm glad I did.Update, lasting power is pretty bad.

I just can’t stand synthetic notes and I can tend to smell them in most designer fragrances. This though, completely unexpected. I have walked past this perfume a dozen times without a second thought of smelling it, knowing I wouldn’t like it, but something stopped me yesterday. I sprayed it on the back of my hand while walking through Ulta and I couldn’t stop putting my hand to my nose. It’s comforting. There is something so familiar about this that I quite literally can’t stop thinking about it. It envelopes me and takes me somewhere, wrapped in memories. Throughout the performance, it becomes lighter, softer but so present. It’s only been 24 hours since I’ve purchased this, but I can’t stop wearing it. I don’t want to stop wearing it. I want to smell this all the time. I’m on my way to pick up a bigger bottle as I know I am going to blow through 1oz of this quickly. Another thing to note is how beautiful the atomizer is, it is soft but perfect. Hah, I just can’t believe this perfume has jumped up to be in the top 5 perfumes I own."

I ran to the bathroom to wash this off and still could smell it on me for the rest of the day:’(Since it’s so warm and AMBERY it might work for some as a winter scent:) But If you’re sensitive to strong scents and dislike amber in general - this is not for you."

It's a scent that appears to have age and depth and yet holds a youthfulness unknown to others in its house. Truly a masterpiece in balance.I am not a huge fan of Ganymede despite its popularity, its masculinity is not to my taste but I can appreciate the quality of its layering and performance. Tilia equally performs and with only one spray on my wrist, I have been entirely engulfed in its scent for hours.To describe the scent, it is very fresh and clean but with a depth that has a sort of woodsy feel. I get a lot of lime in this, more so than any of the other notes. As other reviewers have said, it does have an aquatic essence to it, despite no actual aquatic components. To me it is akin to field of citrus trees, that stand on the bay of a bending river leading into a dark forest. It is woodsy as I said, despite no obvious wood notes, and reminds me of a Midsummer Night's Dream. A scent that a fairy might wear in fact."

Unfortunately, as a fan of this house, I blind bought it. So, I ended up exploring this fragrance more than I expected.But after wearing it 2-3 times, it really grew on me—I love it more than I initially thought I would.It’s clean and soapy with a hint of florals. There's an ambery touch, but it’s not too sharp. It’s pleasant to wear in hot and humid weather (which is common where I live). The longevity and sillage are monstrous, typical of Marc-Antoine Barrois quality.For those interested, I suggest wearing it rather than just smelling it from a strip—you’ll appreciate it much more!"

Not sure what I mean by that but maybe it’s the mineral notes referenced by Sebastian. It’s an interesting fragrance but not one I’d reach for a lot.Edit to say yeah, I agree with the comment below that it smells like old vase water from flowers sitting too long."

I put on two sprays to wear test this based on notes and it is filling the room (my husband commented on how powerful it is and he’s used to me trying fragrances).It’s clean without being too soapy, floral, and slightly spicy. The notes meld in such an interesting way, I don’t pick out individual facets that easily. This would be a great getting out of the shower and want to smell clean scent. Definitely test before buying, I can see how this might be polarizing especially because it is strong."

Like a fairy, walking through a linden field/garden. This will make for a great signature scent. Perfect for safe light too. If there’s a con, I’ll say that it’s not as strong/potent or room filling as it’s been projected by prior reviews. Maybe I’ve gotten anosmic but I don’t get that intensity as described by others."

It's spring in a bottle. I love linden tree flowers and couldn't find a perfume that actually smells like it, but this is on point! It's linden flowers plus that crips, flowery and fresh smell the air has during spring. It also lasts so long on skin, I can still smell it after 8h and one shower."

I don’t see any similarity with Fleur Narcotique or Neroli Amara but it does have some similarities with Encelade, the citrusy part, no Ganymede. I’m not enjoying this, maybe because I used to like linden tea but can’t drink it anymore. Try before you buy."

I received a sample and put it on today, blind. At first I was not loving it, but then the more I smelled it, the more I was intrigued in that it is a fresh scent, but not in the way that aldehydes make a screeching fresh scent on my skin (read: Valaya). Once I got past the opening, I couldn't stop smelling my wrist to see what the scent was going to do next. So far, which is roughly 30 minutes in, I am enjoying this surprise of a gem."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Beautiful linden scent. It’s not something that’s super common as far as florals go so it makes so a unique but not outlandish choice. In my mind there is a faint almost metallic edge, like how spoons at my grandmothers place tasted as a child. It’s a curious classic. Not many people can pin down what the exact flower is because of the linden. But it is like walking past the actual flower, warm sun and a lingering metalic edge that keeps it from becoming sticky sweet"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"To me this smells much more like a mimosa perfume than linden (I live on a linden lined block and the closest to that smell is actually Provence Sante's Tilleul).On initial spray ot smells delightfully golden and practically chokes you with a dusty pollen vibe mixed with heliotrope, though it also registers as saw dust to me, but I enjoy that smell. As it dries down it becomes less dusty and the white floral are more apparent. To me it's more orange blossom than jasmine, woth a bit of a tanginess. It's very femme, maybe even a bit retro, like 1990's retro in the vein of Givenchy Organza which is also a very yellow/golden smelling floral perfume. This is a more expensive smelling version, perhaps, of the same idea. Anyway, I quite like Tilia."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Tilia reminds me about Encelade as they both have similarities and shares DNA partially.Just like Encelade this one is highly potent and gives you strong longevity and projection. No doubt it is high quality.For me Encelade developes into a most beautiful scent after +60-90 minutes. Tilia is a bit more linear and moving more into feminine territory. Did MAB create Tilia for the female audience? Nevertheless Tilia is still a high quality fragrance and would adorn most ladies.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is amazing. Tilia is the kind of perfume that you don't have to go chase down on your arms. It's dominating the air but in an elegant and subtle way. It's not overwhelming at all. To me, it smells like a fresh, slightly sour-ish elderberry lemonade. I enjoy it the most in extreme heat like we have now, 35°C+. It's perfect for a day when you want to smell interesting while also clean and fresh. It's nothing like the usual soapy or musky clean scents. Floral but clean. I think it's rather feminine but I could imagine some men pull it off, too."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Coming back after leaving an earlier raving review - this scent has a personality. We have a strange relationship.For a while, I regretted getting it. There came a point where it almost smelled like....sweat in an Indian market, maybe even metallic pee sometimes. Knowing that that trail was coming sort of turned me off the perfume for a while....but I still found myself wearing it pretty much every other day. I've grown to really love it and accept that it's one of my favourites. It's intriguing in its oddity. Really, a beautiful scent. Once it dries down and fades away, it layers well with others. I've layered its dry down with Solaris, and Sparkling Jo."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"To my nose it is a completely delicious composition, one of the best I have smelled recently. It combines clean and floral aspects in a beautiful way. It makes me feel fresh and elegant but also happy and optimistic.It smells eminently floral, like a bouquet of yellow flowers whose particular identity I don't know, they say linden, at times I also smell broom. What comes to mind is the smell that the breeze brings to you on a walk through a flowery meadow, perhaps next to the sea because there is a salty hint. It has exquisite freshness and cleanliness, without resorting at all to the sweetest and most honeyed side of the yellow flowers, but to the greenest and freshest.However, it is a perfume that I have certain difficulties with. Although the first time I tried Tilia I thought it was a perfume to use in spring-summer, I think that in temperatures that are too high it can be very overwhelming. Also, due to its excellent performance in terms of duration and projection on my skin, I feel that it can saturate if we dose too generously. Furthermore, I find it to be such a long-lasting and linear perfume that I have to space it out a lot and I can't wear it for several consecutive days without ending up tired.On me it has a good projection and a duration that exceeds 12 hours, much longer on clothing or hair.I think I will perhaps buy the bottle in a 30 ml size because it is a perfume that I find wonderful to wear occasionally. I love it especially for relaxed work environments, to give just an example of use where I have felt it fit completely.Smell 8/10Duration 10/10Sillage 8/10Quality/price 5/10Versatility 6/10Packaging 8/10Would I buy again?

It smells like hot metal straight from a polishing machine. In Tilia, on top of that, you get a bouquet of fresh flowers picked from a meadow on a wet, sunny morning—some yellow, some white.And when you smell such a bizarre combo, you can't help but wonder for whom it was created."

The three above mentioned are quite similar to eachother, yet different enough to justify owning all three. I really love the scent profile though. Tilia is different from all three. A slight similarity is there in the opening notes, and way in the background during drydown. Tilia is unique to my nose. There is something woody and spicy. Could it be the georgywood?

It is beautiful, though on me if there's linden here it's waaaaaay in the background. Solid performance as well. I find it a little unfair that the spectrum of what I would consider a woman's scent is so vast while the men's spectrum is so tiny, which is why I'm always reaching for unisex but this to me leans pretty far away from centre. A truly elegant European good looking guy could pull this off. Me, Gen X, not in shape with a beard and from Toronto Canada, not a chance. If I could, I would.PS. This stuff is STRONG and projects like mad. Anyone thinking otherwise has gone nose blind. My wife couldn't taste her dinner when I was around her wearing this.Update: I tried this again and this time I could smell more linden. If this touches your clothes, it's there for a day or two.

I wonder how many of the reviewers have actually taken a whiff of an actual Tilia flower. I can imagine it also being suited for a note in a freshie scent without the heliotrope but a squirt of lemon instead - less grandma-ish perhaps?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I don't understand either the aldehydic or the vintage parallels at all. Tilia is a very floral feminine fragrance, almost creamy and vetiver-spicy, but actually it smells so much of small general field spring flowers that ever since I bought it, I've been thinking about giving it to my mother."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Definitely a vintage vibe. Someone mentioned Musk from Ella K and it actually made me think of Camelia from Ella K, as both have a blend of natural and synthetic notes. But Tilia has a sharpness and a soapiness to it where Camelia is softer, which I prefer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Reminds me of a very old aldehydic scent (60s-70s), more feminine than masculine, quite linear and intrusive, stays on the skin throughout the day. On my skin Tilia sounds like rather aggressive harsh aldehydes mixed with vetiver, with a lot of floral and some green notes and without a pleasant softness of powdery notes. Perhaps the yellow flowers with their volatile diffuse pollen create this sensation. Undoubtedly, a very rare and unusual scent today, but I find it difficult to imagine who would want to smell like that. For me it’s a transport back in time and an undeniable retro smell. Not for the office, not for a date. Makes a very noticeable statement and may suit a strong dominant and/ or artistic personality. May suit a luxurious older man, especially when vetiver undertones become prominent. Not recommended for young people! Not a blind buy as you might have guessed.P.S. 36 hours later I still have a super strong scent on a blotter, tickling the nostrils as if just sprayed into the air and a bit annoying, to be true. It's so powerful that one bottle will last you a lifetime!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Update: After sampling this over a few months I fell in love with the scent and now find it very different from Fleur Narcotique. Where Fleur is Spring flowers with a crispy air in spring, Tilia is yellow flowers on a hot summers day. Bought a full bottle. Love it.Smells like a mix of Bois Imperial and Fleur Narcotique/ Levant- has good lasting power but probably redundant for me to own as I have Fleur Narcotique/ Levant. Also- this has a sort of rotting tea leaf note which I can't get past but I do think layering this with Fleur Narcotique will increase the lasting power of Narcotique."

It makes sense as Ganymede is my #1 fragrance of all time and this shares the same DNA. It's different enough to justify owning both...Ganymede is pure hay....like being in the middle of a field in late summer. Both of them bloom in the humid heat of Atlanta. Every time I go nose blind to Tilia, I step outside for a few seconds and it opens back up."

Florals have been massively growing on me and just WOW! Tilia is clean and gorgeous with one of the absolute best yellow floral qualities I’ve ever smelled. Have never smelled another lime/linden blossom like this one!! Received decants of this and Ganymede and as of now a bottle of Tilia may very well be in my future. Definitely has a little Valaya from PDM in there, another shout out to the “reminds me of” section. But it isn’t quite as feminine and as a male I’d totally wear this, it has a prettiness but just doesn’t come across as feminine overall.Edit 6/29: I’ve decided my 5ml decant won’t cut it and I will be buying at least a 30ml bottle, Im seeing they run around $115 off discounters and it’s calling my name. Tilia is a fragrance that blows my mind every time I smell it, the epitome of a must have.Layer tip: Nishane Wulong Cha - the addition of citrus and green citrus elements with the herbal tea to Tilia’s next-level yellow florals truly form something special, so gorgeous and airy.

That one is even creepier ... It's rare for me to hate a perfume, yes, but those2 and Metallique with passion, brother!PS I realize that nerves prevented me from actually writing a review so I'm coming back to correct this oversight.This perfume is a perfumery error and horror. I don't know how QB could combine such sweet and delicate flowers as linden and osmanthus with that hideous chemical called ambrofix, ambroxan, amberwood, damn it. I'm sure he still has something, that nauseous something, the DNA you smelled in Ganymede as well. This thing turns the delicate flowers into something mutant, a la Chernobyl. And it makes you never want to smell it again, lest it alter your love for them.That's about it about the MAB house, for which I will never have any curiosity."

I am 7 or 8 years old, standing in the kitchen, reaching into the lower cabinet for a large 3-liter jar of linden honey. I take a tablespoon and dip it into the viscous, amber-colored honey. The scent is literally a spoonful of honey in front of me, and I inhale this delicate, sweet aroma. These are amazing emotions. Bravo Bisch!"

This is one of those sad journeys from scent stick (joy) to skin (revulsion). On paper, literally, this smells like the most addictive and bewitching bouquet of flowers. I was told it was linden beforehand, so the store associate led the witness a bit, but I loved it instantly. It was really refreshing to encounter a less common (to my nose) floral. In the store, I had already tried a few fragrances on my skin and didn't want to clutter things, so I didn't get the chance to try this on myself right then and there, but I did get a sample for the road. I'd been saving it because I was certain I was going to love it. Sadly, now that I've finally tried it, I'm feeling so turned off. It honestly, on me, smells like dirty flower water. And the more I smell it, the more of a headache I get. I'm not sensitive or opposed to ambroxan, iso e super, etc – in fact, I tend to love them. So I'm surprised at how funky this one becomes. Bye bye, Tilia."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Gorgeous summer scent. Sometimes yellow florals can be a bit much for me or too tropical smelling but this one is nothing like that. It’s Summery, ever so slightly sweet, a touch soapy for those that love a good “clean” note, the vetiver is there but not screeching at you. It’s so well blended. Solar with a pinch of salt, just lovely. Again as with the other MAB scents I’ve tried it has this quality of beast mode longevity without beast mode intensity. Quentin Bisch has mastered “soft beast mode,” if that makes sense. I can’t imagine any of the MAB frags I’ve tried being offensive to anyone. They’re all pleasant, comforting, and nostalgic, with major lasting power. This vibe is a relaxing lunch at a hillside winery with a garden full of jasmine nearby on a warm but not too hot day. I CANNOT WAIT to layer this with my Holy Grail scent Ganymede. Tilia immediately smelled familiar like a perfume I’d tried before but couldn’t place. Then it hit me, this is an excellent substitute for La Perla Possibilities if you’re like me and never got your hands on it before it was impossible to find and extremely expensive when you did. I find Tilia and Possibilities to be quite similar (based on memory, didn’t do a side by side test). Idk if I’d need a full bottle bc I like to wear a lot of different scents but I’d definitely consider a 30ml size once my decant is out. Beautiful, sophisticated, Summer stunner."

Starts with a combination of powdery Heliotrope and Linden blossom - lightly honeyed and lemon-like. Then the Jasmine elements of Linden blossom come into play. But the balance between the powder and fresh florals is magical. I also get a metallic yet salty smell coming from an amber like material and rooty facets from Vetiver on a base of white musk. Radiant.

Absolutely addictive.The florals at times smell a bit grapey. I’ve never smelled linden flowers but this perfume made me smell that note for the first time and I love it (if ur an experienced nose you will be able to pick it up right away).Nearly identical to possibilities by La Perla which that is what I thought I sprayed on.Possibilities is denser& sweeter/powdery fluffy. However this is more spicy ambroxan unisex leaning.I honestly prefer this , and I sold my 2 (discontinued) possibilities perfumes to purchase this instead .Lasts and projects all day.STUNNING . Unisex but in my opinion it does lean feminine"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"As a child, growing up in Kentucky, my family had a large towering tree that lived in our backyard. It was my sanctuary. I used to use the tree as many settings for my imagination. I can still remember the smell of the leaves that danced in the wind of a cool summer day. That smell embodies most of my childhood. Fast forward to the release of Marc Antoine Barrois Tilia and that scent memory is awoken from my childhood memories.Tilia is Barrois sixth fragrance in his collection perfumed by Quentin Bisch and the fourth original after releasing the extrait of Ganymede and B683. With this release, the leather undertones that made up his previous fragrances are left behind and a focus on floral are brought to life, but the focus isn't your typical floral but that of linden or Lime tree as it is most commonly referred to. The Lime Tree gives off a honeyed citrus smell that is similar to a lime's peel. It's sweet, but invigorating and calming at the same time. The smell is encapsulated beautifully in this fragrance and supported with the notes of vetiver, heliotrope, and Ambrofix which is a proprietary note used by Givaudan, the company in which Bisch perfumes for.After testing this fragrance in the heat, cooler climate, and normal settings, it is undoubtedly an unexpected beast. My first wearing was five sprays which overwhelmed me and even two sprays left a strong presence. It is remarkably sweet, but not overbearing. It's a calm scent, with a big presence. After nine hours of wear Tilia was still alive on skin. It acts linear, but you do get moments when the vetiver slips out, if only subtly to give the fragrance just hint of spice. I adore this fragrance. It is sexy and masculine, but unisex where a female could easy pull this off. Great for all seasons and Signature Scent worthy. Another stellar release from Marc Antoine Barrois and magnificent creation from Quentin Bisch. It's a lovely reminder of a childhood now lost, but a scent memory forever captured. Stay Scent'd."

It’s really pleasant without breaking the mold, a well-rounded and smooth creation that does not provoke too much, a sort of comfort floral that anyone can appreciate, I’d wager. It’s fittingly a little mellower in the dry down than in the opening, albeit with a similar balance.Tilia performs quite well, with good density, at EDP concentration, pricing of $280/160 for 100/30ml (similar to other perfumes in the line), sold at boutiques like Perfumology that carry the line.7 out of 10"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"The linden scent is better known in Europe than in North America. It's a calming, gracious yellow floral note that reminds many people of limes (which is why in the British Isles the linden tree is called the lime tree, even though it does not produce actual lime fruits). This may be a somewhat surprising dominant note from a Marc-Antoine Barrois fragrance, since the house has avoided florals mostly so far, but we've been promised this will be the first in a line of them. It does share a slight DNA resemblance to the more famous MAB scents like Ganymede, in that something in this (I would guess the Ambrofix) creates a slightly metallic undertone here.This is incredibly powerful stuff, especially at the opening, which is bright and attention-getting. It smoothes down but is still pretty big throughout. I really enjoy this, and the pollen-like scent (from the linden and the broom) suggests elegant, pretty sunny days. This would be the perfect thing to wear to a wedding or any other fancy daytime spring or summer occasion no matter your gender, since yellow florals to my mind are pretty unisex."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"highly repetitive fragrance, heavily ambroxed fleur narcotique"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Every once and awhile I find a fragrance that I get excited about. This is one of them. When I first received my sample, off paper I thought, 'Well, this is definitely leaning more feminine than I would like."" I put it in my pile and went about pulling for other samples each day, but something at night would pull me to smell this one again and again. Finally, I wore it. Guys, this is wonderful. What I first thought was surely feminine is, in fact, perfectly Unisex.What does this smell like? Well, Quinton Bisch also was the Perfumor on a limited edition fragrance for Liquides Imaginaires called Liquide Gold. This borrowers a ton from that fragrance. I'd say about 75% . Liquide Gold is one of my all-time favorites, so seeing what he did to play with that masterpiece (IMHO) DNA is exciting.They both share the warmth or ""glow"" that in the Liquide Gold I attribute to the Solar Notes. Given not many notes listed for Tilia I'm not sure but I'm guessing many of the same notes were used.It's warm without being heavy, bright or glowing overall. There's a perfect amount of sweetness much like you would find in a flower with a heavier aroma. ""Tilia"" is the genus or family of tree that the Linden Blossom belongs to. This showcases the Linden Blossom perfect. Sweet, yellow ,honey and Honeysuckle scent. The Jasmine acts to give a silky feel and isn't overpowering at all. I get a good amount of Broom in this with its dusty sweet qualities. Of course a good amount of Ambrofix that ties everything together. Helotrope yes, not a ton but definitely perceivable. Adds a softness along with the other florals. Not much Vetiver, at least not that I noticed as of yet. The blend is seamless here.This says Springtime to me. It's happy, hopeful, warm and dense but not heavy. In fact my only complaint is performance. More on the projection size. It lasts a long time. 8+ hours but it sits close after the first hour.Of the two, Liquide Gold is more complex, and overall, the better fragrance, but I love this as well. It's definitely worth having but sample first. Perfect for Spring and most any occasion"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Boys, don’t be afraid of this one. It’s feminine-leaning in its opening, but gradually transitions to be more unisex. The base note is when that unmistakable Marc-Antoine Barro + Quentin Bisch DNA (spacial / atmospheric / metallic) reveals itself, and -believe it or not- behind all the flowers, there’s what appears to be a single droplet of Encelade that holds the composition together.In the same way that Quentin Bisch blended all those peculiar consumer synthetic smells to create Ganymede (electronics, new car seats etc) and turned them into something wearable and nostalgic, Tilia achieves the same nostalgia, just this time through florals. The end result is an uplifting, soapy vibe reminiscent of your childhood home’s laundry room on a glorious spring day."

Almost velvety blooms with a corona of polleny-powdery goodness and a sprinkle of golden glitter.A warm creamy mid with a golden warmth pushes up under the flowers rising above the earth and towards the sun.The mid onwards displays a silvery woodiness that is almost metallic silver giving the feel mutated flower stems and this deepens coming to the fore with an almost nutty mushroomy nuance. Not awful or rotten, just at the edge of the scent.This is nuclear and as the mid and base come through the scent gets stronger.She’s not shy and retiring - caution with application is wise. For all that she is gorgeousOne spray on the back of my hand is still projecting strongly 9 hours after spray. Reflection 45 which was on the other hand, is now a skin scent in comparison.I’m getting a decant to sample more as she’s a rare scent that I think is too strong to wear with a single spray.

As it is a soliflor and that particular scent profile is an accord in itself, I can't help but think this Fragrance has a personal memory attached to it. Almost feels like a love letter to that particular moment and done so gently and benevolently.

Linear, clean perfume about soft, powdery, and honeyed flowers blooming outdoors on a sunny day in May. To me, Tilia has Green tea (Elizabeth Arden) vibes. Something about it is a bit retro, like a perfume your mother would wear to work.Tilia has that soapiness of freshly washed clothes and synthetic quality (like a cleaning product or a laundry detergent) which reminds me a bit of La Tulipe by Byredo.You can get a decent freshie in Oriflame for this price, which would not be much worse: Oriflame worked (still works?) with such master perfumers as Olivier Cresp, Maurice Roucel, Nathalie Lorson... If I didn't try Tilia in a niche perfume store and smelled it on a stranger without knowing the perfume's name, I would most likely say it was something from Oriflame:)Tilia is not about the linden blossom. It's there but in the background, masterfully blended with other notes...Personal rating: 5/13"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Soapy, soft, airy, slightly powdery yellow floral. Initial projection is quite loud even though the scent itself wears thin, if that makes sense. It feels translucent. Settles down to a soapy skin scent after a while, with moderate longevity. Fairly linear, not much development.It's a radically different animal compared to the other, beastly fragrances by MAB.I quite like the happy floral profile. I suspect most men will be scared to wear this though. This man however would be quite happy to wear this, but as much as I'd hoped this would be a love, it's just a like for now. I don't get any woodiness, nor do I get any typical brand DNA. I would never have been able to tell it's a MAB in a blind test.Not sure how original this is though. I haven't tested that many yellow florals. Worth a sniff, but don't blind buy. It might be a bit overhyped.As it stands, I'll probably skip this. I don't love it enough for the price it commands."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I had hoped for a linden blossom closer to the real thing (senselessly - this is Barrois and Bisch after all), which is one of my favorite smells in nature. However, this is close enough. More citrus and sparkle (think 'tisane de tilleul avec miel et citron', brought to you so hot it glitters). Makes you keep smelling yourself. All in all, good work on the conceptual framing, all fits together great.Longevity is nuclear though. Careful with spraying on clothes, else you'll have to burn them to get rid of the scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I love this scent. The heliotrope comes through strongly at first. Then it fades into the smell of fresh bedsheets that you're lingering in on a cool yet warm summer morning, when everything feels right in the world. The honey brings all of this floral harmony together, and almost reminds me of Nefs.I tried the sample, and it was one of those ""full body yes"" feeling, and went to get a full bottle. So glad I get to embody this scent!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I LOVE THIS !!!The beginning (like the first 10-15 seconds) all I'm sensing is a hot cup of linden blossom tea.Then it settles down and I'm under a linden tree in full bloom.The jasmine is making itself noticeable as well, and starts their beautiful dance with the linden blossom.The scent overall is refreshing, honey sweet, well blended and the performance is phenomenal. It lasts around 16 hours on skin for me with massive projection in the first 4 hours, then it calms down but you can feel it throughout the day.When I first tried this fragrance, I thought of Neroli Amara by VCA (another masterpiece from Bisch). For me they are in the same realm and carry a similar feeling, the same vibe.Quentin Bisch definitely knows his florals - Fleur Narcotique, Neroli Amara, the Delinas, and now Tilia.Amazing fragrance that MAB dropped right when it was needed.I need a full bottle asap but my wallet is side eyeing me..."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is a fresher take on Tilia. You definitely get the unmistakable smell of Linden blossoms right from the get go in here, but the addition of jasmine sambac is noticeable and gives an almost soapy edge to it. I’m surprised I like it since I’m not usually a soap in perfume person. It’s extremely subtle but serves to lighten a bit of the typical almost syrupy sweetness of lime blossom. There is honey also for sweetness, and a little bit of balsamic vanilla, but for me they add a sort of textural feel of density at this perfume’s heart as opposed to adding to what could be overbearing sugariness. In addition there’s an aromatic green quality to this that’s very appealing and makes it a bit more unisex than the typical Linden blossom is. And it makes it perfect for hot weather, as it wears a bit lighter and lifts off the skin more than some other Lindens I have. What’s interesting to me is that I smell every single one of the listed accords/ notes in here. I don’t consider myself a super smeller so that’s exciting. This one projects really well and lasts forever- 24 hours or more."

But Tilia isn't it. Sorry. I get more of a magnolia scent than a linden blossom. The opening is light, so light you just smell alcohol. Once it settles, a powdery floral note emerges. Heliotropin and a bit of tuberose round out the soft linden accord. But then 30 min in, I'm left with a cloying magnolia perfume—one that induces a little headache. Reminded me of L'Occitane's Magnolia, TBH. It's somehow too light and too much at the same time. My favorite floral perfume from Bisch is L'Artisan Iris de Gris. However, if you like magnolia this might be right for you. I don't so it's a pass for me."

This makes it so personal and extra special!I've now had it on my wrists for a couple of hours and I love the opening! It's a fairytale! To me it smells of spring, awakening nature, melting snow and first blossoms of the year, subtle, tender, fresh and oh, so delicate! This is a total opposite of Ganymede - softness and delicate feminity vs. untamed power and strength of masculinity.After an hour or so it develops into a strong Iso E super and Ambroxan duet - at least that's all I can smell. And while not unpleasant, here it loses its uniqueness. I smell exactly like this after an hour of wearing Blue Talisman or Valaya ( and, a bit less, but still - Fleur Narcotique).I will keep it and I will wear it, asI adore the starting notes, but I do feel a bit of regret that with the arrival of syntetic ingedients many perfumes end up smelling the same in their base notes."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"There's something about Quentin Bisch's ongoing collaboration with Marc Antoine Barrois that continues to deliver perfumes elevated above the norms of the industry, and Tilia is not an exception.With a fairly linear design, the sixth perfume by the brand is pure happiness, bottled. Yes, detractors might suggest Tilia is one more in a line of releases where the perfumer is ploughing an already ploughed field, that it's Bisch returning to his old book of tricks. And in truth, there is the well used formula of sparkly astral twinkles. No one claims that a new Chypre on the market is a cheap cash in on the success of previous Chypres, these days at least. And I could argue Bisch has succeeded in creating a sort of genre all of his own, 'The Bisch'. Perhaps in future, perfume historians might remark of 'Bischyness'. Oddly, the best 'Bisch' might not even by signed by the man himself, eventually.Anyway, similarities aside, Tilia is so much brighter, sunnier, and happier than the previous five. It's potent and lasting. as are all his works for the brand. It bursts forth with the most solar of blossoms and a confectionary, opiate, nectar. It's no normal nectar, but that of the gods; honeyed, sweet, and airy. There's an ounce of aldehydic powder and it does feel a little like clean linen upon drying down on skin, however don't be fooled. This is not your regular washing detergent smell, look to L'eau Papier or 312 St Honore for that. This here is the smell of fresh laundry, laundered in heaven's laundrette by Apollo himself and left out to dry on the line next to the linden trees.It's a stunning release and one perfectly timed for the seasonal shifts that bring the more summery side of perfumery into play.

Just get it! If you’re looking to get something for a woman you love, this is it. The duo of MAB and Quentin Bisch does not disappoint! This is a beautiful, soft but potent as heck, perfume! I get a slight hint of Ganymede. It has that airy sort of mineral note the house does so well. The top notes feel yellow and creamy, lush greens, a tad powdery, but modern. I am so happy I got this!"

I think this is great! I don't exactly know what it is but there is truly a DNA of Marc Antoine Barrois perfumes, that one thing that all these perfumes have in common. I do not know what it is but it is just something, some a little light metallic note that just sparks a DNA of this brand.I kind of get a tiny crumbs of Encelade in here, but not a lot, there is nothing very similar to these perfumes, but just a tiny glims second reminds me of Encelade. It is sweet but definitely not super feminine, it is unisex, if you are a male who likes sweeter perfumes you can truly pull this off. It is a warm solar floral scent, just beautiful and radiating! Truly a power house. It does not disappoint with longevity and sillage I can definitely tell you that... Does not disappoint! You can spray this and move on with your day and you will still smell like this perfume the next day even if you took a shower.

Mentioned, that if she should pick one of all of the hundreds of frags from the store, she would choose this one (for male and female also). Its something special. Same emotions as when I first met with Ganymede. Although I think it wont have the same success as that oneAbsolutely unisex"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I was hoping for a lighthearted linden scent, summery, warm and welcoming. There is definitely some of it there. Some nice gentle florals, leaning to a natural beeswax /slightest bit of piss. But primarily I get a rough, harsh feeling from it. Like some plants, some wood (like guaiac) are there, shifting the focus to another direction. Which is assertive, ""I know what I want"", modern, perfect, expensive woman. That harsher modern base reminds me of Bois Imperial by Essential Parfums. Very good performance, just not my type of scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I do not know what to make of this; it's a 'nice' smell, it's unique, very unique, at least to me anyway. I'm going to be a bit useless here at describing the smell so I'll just do my best from my POV.The fragrance has a floral something, and a tad sweet, but very very well balanced, it's definitely feminine leaning, but not like in the way something an Avon lady would be selling, no you can smell the quality totally. But, and here is the big but; if you're expecting a feminine Ganymede or Encelade you'll be in for a big disappointment, the fragrance's saving grace is in it's quality, longevity, scent bubble and 'feel good' vibe like everyone else has mentioned. It really does smell like sunshine in a bottle, but not the sun you find at the beach, nope the kind you'd find in a gorgeous field near to an old village with the sun beaming and feeling of fresh honey and milk (no, this has no laconic notes at all to me).It's a 'happy smell' a bit like Ani is a happy smell, although the 2 are completely different, I was referring to the context rather than the scent. To me this lacks MAB's DNA, smells nothing like his other ones. I bought the 30ml because I remember when I bought Encelade and Ganymede I thought that there would be some still left in the bottle for my great grandson's inheritance :D. It's not a safe buy, but then again it's not challenging, anyone can wear it, anytime, any place, but it would be a waste at a formal event, it's just too much of a happy smellI hope I've helped shed a tad of light on how this fragrance plays it's tune somehow, enjoy and God bless......UPDATE: I'm in love, probably regret getting the 30ml, but hey it will make me possibly wear it a bit more, it's really happiness in a bottle."

The only good thing in my opinion is the power: it’s devine, lasts more then 6 hours with a wide and constant projection.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Blindbought this as a 110kg gym bro and I’m beginning to feel like it might have been a mistake (I seriously dislike the other three from the brand, plus the official review claims it’s feminine).I’ll be back and edit this comment after testing, may I have a thumbs up warmup?.edit OK I got it.What worried me a lot was when I sprayed it was a horrible blast of the cheapest rubbing alcohol you could imagine, immediately and for the first at least 30 seconds. I imagine this isn't top heavy (even though this also happens to a lot of citrus).If you let it settle the fun begins. The first thing I immediately smell is soap - but hold your horses. I remember 85% of this smell exactly the same as a Bath and Body works soap I once had, opened a timeline window in my brain instantly but when I smell it a bit longer and ask my wife for opinion I start to get why. My wife, not knowing this soap, pretty accurately said 'smells of a clean and soft jasmine and orange'. I don't get the orange, but neroli - oh yeah so, in my opinion, most of this perfume is a natural, expensive jasmine and neroli soap. I do get some sunscreen vibe, there’s a chance there’s monoï here. Moving on, I get the linden blossom but to my nose it's not the main note - I stick with jasmine and neroli soap for that. The linden reminds me of a candy you can get in Poland - there's a brand called Verbena that does 'healthy' candy with different herbs, flowers etc and it smells exactly like the linden candy tastes. The vetiver and ambroxan give it a juicy, aromatic, and slightly metallic feel in the base. My wife mentions baby powder and I do get the powderyness, can't really say that it is in fact the baby powder or any other powder. There is a slight almond heliotropine vibe but both the almond and powder are rather as a backbone, a structural note than a focal point of the fragrance. Overall it is sweetened, but not really sweet. Altogether it does make a yellow pollen vibe, but it's not honeyed, it's not sugary..edit2 the longer I test it the more I think there’s actually monoï here, ylang ylang, frangipani, mimosa, maybe even a bit of tuberose. I’m also not 100% sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised for Osmanthus and litsea cubebaIt does smell of linden blossom to someone who doesn't deconstruct. When you do, as I said before.Can this be worn as a man? Sure, ain't nobody telling a big dog like me what I can, and cannot do. Should it be, is a different pair of shoes. Tilia stays with me, but it's absolutely not blind buy worthy for a man. I imagine a man wearing it in a high heat, 25C+, maybe even wearing white flax shirt. Beach, city centre, all OK but overall? It might lean feminine. My wife exact words were 'I'm gonna be sneaking up on this bottle and use it, too' .Performance? I don't know. Smells strong on my hand but I can't feel it around myself but the exact same thing happens to me with Bergamask soooo... I'll update on that when I get some feedback from others around me.Would I guess blindly that this is Marc Antoine Barrois? No, as I hate the previous releases, they all smell of a dentist's office in the base to me. That's a little bit too strong for ELdO, a little bit too loud, bold, and maybe slightly synthetic for Chanel feminine jasmine release. Wouldn't be surprised somebody told me it's Xerjoff, but I also wound't make a guess like that. I do get some aspects of the previously mentioned but also some Guerlain vibes, some Profumum Roma, maybe even BDK. A feminine Amouage release also does sound OK-ish. To be honest, MAB and Quentin Bisch wouldn't even cross my mind."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Gorgeous summer scent. Sometimes yellow florals can be a bit much for me or too tropical smelling but this one is nothing like that. It’s Summery, ever so slightly sweet, a touch soapy for those that love a good “clean” note, the vetiver is there but not screeching at you. It’s so well blended. Solar with a pinch of salt, just lovely. Again as with the other MAB scents I’ve tried it has this quality of beast mode longevity without beast mode intensity. Quentin Bisch has mastered “soft beast mode,” if that makes sense. I can’t imagine any of the MAB frags I’ve tried being offensive to anyone. They’re all pleasant, comforting, and nostalgic, with major lasting power. This vibe is a relaxing lunch at a hillside winery with a garden full of jasmine nearby on a warm but not too hot day. I CANNOT WAIT to layer this with my Holy Grail scent Ganymede. Tilia immediately smelled familiar like a perfume I’d tried before but couldn’t place. Then it hit me, this is an excellent substitute for La Perla Possibilities if you’re like me and never got your hands on it before it was impossible to find and extremely expensive when you did. I find Tilia and Possibilities to be quite similar (based on memory, didn’t do a side by side test). Idk if I’d need a full bottle bc I like to wear a lot of different scents but I’d definitely consider a 30ml size once my decant is out. Beautiful, sophisticated, Summer stunner."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"As a child, growing up in Kentucky, my family had a large towering tree that lived in our backyard. It was my sanctuary. I used to use the tree as many settings for my imagination. I can still remember the smell of the leaves that danced in the wind of a cool summer day. That smell embodies most of my childhood. Fast forward to the release of Marc Antoine Barrois Tilia and that scent memory is awoken from my childhood memories.Tilia is Barrois sixth fragrance in his collection perfumed by Quentin Bisch and the fourth original after releasing the extrait of Ganymede and B683. With this release, the leather undertones that made up his previous fragrances are left behind and a focus on floral are brought to life, but the focus isn't your typical floral but that of linden or Lime tree as it is most commonly referred to. The Lime Tree gives off a honeyed citrus smell that is similar to a lime's peel. It's sweet, but invigorating and calming at the same time. The smell is encapsulated beautifully in this fragrance and supported with the notes of vetiver, heliotrope, and Ambrofix which is a proprietary note used by Givaudan, the company in which Bisch perfumes for.After testing this fragrance in the heat, cooler climate, and normal settings, it is undoubtedly an unexpected beast. My first wearing was five sprays which overwhelmed me and even two sprays left a strong presence. It is remarkably sweet, but not overbearing. It's a calm scent, with a big presence. After nine hours of wear Tilia was still alive on skin. It acts linear, but you do get moments when the vetiver slips out, if only subtly to give the fragrance just hint of spice. I adore this fragrance. It is sexy and masculine, but unisex where a female could easy pull this off. Great for all seasons and Signature Scent worthy. Another stellar release from Marc Antoine Barrois and magnificent creation from Quentin Bisch. It's a lovely reminder of a childhood now lost, but a scent memory forever captured. Stay Scent'd."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Boys, don’t be afraid of this one. It’s feminine-leaning in its opening, but gradually transitions to be more unisex. The base note is when that unmistakable Marc-Antoine Barro + Quentin Bisch DNA (spacial / atmospheric / metallic) reveals itself, and -believe it or not- behind all the flowers, there’s what appears to be a single droplet of Encelade that holds the composition together.In the same way that Quentin Bisch blended all those peculiar consumer synthetic smells to create Ganymede (electronics, new car seats etc) and turned them into something wearable and nostalgic, Tilia achieves the same nostalgia, just this time through florals. The end result is an uplifting, soapy vibe reminiscent of your childhood home’s laundry room on a glorious spring day."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Marc-Antoine-Barrois/Tilia-91688.html,Tilia Marc-Antoine Barrois perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Blindbought this as a 110kg gym bro and I’m beginning to feel like it might have been a mistake (I seriously dislike the other three from the brand, plus the official review claims it’s feminine).I’ll be back and edit this comment after testing, may I have a thumbs up warmup?.edit OK I got it.What worried me a lot was when I sprayed it was a horrible blast of the cheapest rubbing alcohol you could imagine, immediately and for the first at least 30 seconds. I imagine this isn't top heavy (even though this also happens to a lot of citrus).If you let it settle the fun begins. The first thing I immediately smell is soap - but hold your horses. I remember 85% of this smell exactly the same as a Bath and Body works soap I once had, opened a timeline window in my brain instantly but when I smell it a bit longer and ask my wife for opinion I start to get why. My wife, not knowing this soap, pretty accurately said 'smells of a clean and soft jasmine and orange'. I don't get the orange, but neroli - oh yeah so, in my opinion, most of this perfume is a natural, expensive jasmine and neroli soap. I do get some sunscreen vibe, there’s a chance there’s monoï here. Moving on, I get the linden blossom but to my nose it's not the main note - I stick with jasmine and neroli soap for that. The linden reminds me of a candy you can get in Poland - there's a brand called Verbena that does 'healthy' candy with different herbs, flowers etc and it smells exactly like the linden candy tastes. The vetiver and ambroxan give it a juicy, aromatic, and slightly metallic feel in the base. My wife mentions baby powder and I do get the powderyness, can't really say that it is in fact the baby powder or any other powder. There is a slight almond heliotropine vibe but both the almond and powder are rather as a backbone, a structural note than a focal point of the fragrance. Overall it is sweetened, but not really sweet. Altogether it does make a yellow pollen vibe, but it's not honeyed, it's not sugary..edit2 the longer I test it the more I think there’s actually monoï here, ylang ylang, frangipani, mimosa, maybe even a bit of tuberose. I’m also not 100% sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised for Osmanthus and litsea cubebaIt does smell of linden blossom to someone who doesn't deconstruct. When you do, as I said before.Can this be worn as a man? Sure, ain't nobody telling a big dog like me what I can, and cannot do. Should it be, is a different pair of shoes. Tilia stays with me, but it's absolutely not blind buy worthy for a man. I imagine a man wearing it in a high heat, 25C+, maybe even wearing white flax shirt. Beach, city centre, all OK but overall? It might lean feminine. My wife exact words were 'I'm gonna be sneaking up on this bottle and use it, too' .Performance? I don't know. Smells strong on my hand but I can't feel it around myself but the exact same thing happens to me with Bergamask soooo... I'll update on that when I get some feedback from others around me.Would I guess blindly that this is Marc Antoine Barrois? No, as I hate the previous releases, they all smell of a dentist's office in the base to me. That's a little bit too strong for ELdO, a little bit too loud, bold, and maybe slightly synthetic for Chanel feminine jasmine release. Wouldn't be surprised somebody told me it's Xerjoff, but I also wound't make a guess like that. I do get some aspects of the previously mentioned but also some Guerlain vibes, some Profumum Roma, maybe even BDK. A feminine Amouage release also does sound OK-ish. To be honest, MAB and Quentin Bisch wouldn't even cross my mind."

That one is even creepier ... It's rare for me to hate a perfume, yes, but those2 and Metallique with passion, brother!PS I realize that nerves prevented me from actually writing a review so I'm coming back to correct this oversight.This perfume is a perfumery error and horror. I don't know how QB could combine such sweet and delicate flowers as linden and osmanthus with that hideous chemical called ambrofix, ambroxan, amberwood, damn it. I'm sure he still has something, that nauseous something, the DNA you smelled in Ganymede as well. This thing turns the delicate flowers into something mutant, a la Chernobyl. And it makes you never want to smell it again, lest it alter your love for them.That's about it about the MAB house, for which I will never have any curiosity."

A bit of Paragon, mixed with some Angel's Share & a touch of something that resembles Kilian's Apple Brandy/Boss Bottled. I think that a combination of those 3 in the right measure would give you an overall effect similar to this fragrance. Not a bad fragrance but something which is definitely safe, but it doesn't move me. If you like those fragrances and you're after something safe, mass appealing and comforting you could do worse.

Get it if you can't afford this Initio. More cherry forward, with the cognac, rose, dry tobacco and a little vanilla.I find Side Effect and Narcotic Delight close enough to be pointless owning both. The main differences to me are how the cherry and tobacco notes are used. Narcotic Delight is darker; more fuzzy; heavier on the cherry, and the tobacco is somewhat ashy (reminiscent of burnt wood), whereas the tobacco in Side Effect is richer and more alluring. The boozy note here is more prominent though - makes for a smooth dry-down. I am a fan of the patchouli note, and happy that it makes a subtle appearance about two or three hours in, sadly not lasting long enough.It changes more on skin than Side Effect. If you like a darker, almost charred wood scent added to what you'll get from Side Effect then you will find it in Narcotic Delight. An interesting scent; more niche than Side Effect."

It is cozy all year round; forget the people talking about season appropriate fragrances: this works at all times; plus, if you wear it during the summer, when everyone is smelling like lemon and fruits, you will be a breath of fresh air everywhere you go - ironically enough. The dry down turns more spicy and floral - and slightly less sweet, but sweet stays always. This is very pretty and seductive and not medicinal as some tend to say; the pretty girls love it and i love the pretty girls - so things work out; and as a man, i dig this on pretty girls too; A pretty girl should always smell sweet and cozy; none of that citrusy fruity stuff or woody leather: girls: always sweet and cozy if your intention is to allure; but wear what you dig if you aren't trying to pull.

After an hour an earthen greeny darkness with a touch of tobacco bodies out the scent where as after an hour in Side Effect retains its sweet slightly stickier jammy rose retains a slow linear decline for the life of the scent.Original:Absolutely gorgeous scent.I don’t understand votes for this not being like Madja Bekkali Fusion Sacree - it’s remarkably alike with a different note make up and perhaps a skew toward a stronger vanillic base where as this is more finished off with tobacco dry sweet pipe tobacco notes.Some comments comparing to Side Effect - one of my faves are somewhat valid however the dry down on this is geared toward the Baccy and the Cherry opening is awesome.Gorgeous tobacco scent also somewhat remiscent of Carolina Herrera Mystery Tobacco.My only complaint is that it is a tad less in performance compared to most of the Initio lineup."

This makes me very sad. I don't even really understand what happened. Here we go:I got a carded sample of Narcotic Delight from a reliable eBay seller two weeks ago. I sprayed it on my wrist, and I was intrigued. An hour later it was love! The dry down was amazing. I checked the notes here on Fragrantica and I was ecstatic! I could smell the cherry, the booze, the tobacco... it was heaven. Better than Lost Cherry (and I love Lost Cherry) in every way possible. The performance was stellar! I could smell it all the next day. I found the Holy Grail of fragrances.I'd found a real unicorn and I loved it and it loved me back.So I ordered a 14ml decant from an Etsy seller. (Initio was out. I had to make do somehow.) The decant arrived last week.I sprayed the decant on my wrist, let it dry, and... ew. What horror was this?I didn't recognize it at all. Whatever that Etsy seller had put in that bottle was super gross. It certainly wasn't Narcotic Delight. I started to get very angry. But before I could write the scathing review that would serve as that huckster's epitaph, I had to test the perfume one final time. Just to make sure.The next morning, after we all showered and were completely free of other perfumes, my daughter and son and I all tried both fragrances. Sample on one wrist, decant on the other. And lo and behold, we came to the gradual realization that the decant was actually-- exactly the same as the carded sample. Exactly.We all agreed. I was stunned.My unicorn vanished. And I can't explain it. I don't know what happened.TL;DR: All I know is, one week Narcotic Delight was the best cherry fragrance I have ever experienced. But the next week that same fragrance was muck. I don't think I have Covid; I can smell everything else just fine.For those of you that can still smell Narcotic Delight, and you love it, don't take it for granted. It is amazing!

If you think they smell similar, get your nose checked. They are two completely different scents and aren't alike at all, so don't be fooled by the comparisons. This is much more in the vein of a Pure Havane. It's a sweet, cherry pipe tobacco scent."

To preface....I HATE artificial cherry. But this does not give off artificial cherry; it's a black cherry. A sexy, spicy black cherry vanilla fragrance. It's spiciest at the beginning, which dissipates after 30 minutes as the hedione, cognac, and vanilla join the party. It settles into a luxurious cherry tobacco vanilla that is intoxicating to the nose. I've said sexy three times during this review, and I'm going to say this again; this is sexy.Perfectly unisex, I can see how this will come across differently depending on the wearer. 100% date and event appropriate for the evening in fall and winter, as I don't think this will perform well in the spring/summer heat.Happy to have finally found an Initio fragrance that I absolutely love!"

From the moment I got a few wears out of a sample I knew I had to buy a full bottle which I recently managed to do, on special - so at a decent price.This is a gorgeous and addictive cherry and peppery opening which dries down into the most intoxicating cognac / tobacco base. I always spray on my hand so I can continually smell it, and can never seem to keep my nose off it. It's that gorgeous and addictive. Perfectly unisex and perfect for the current cold winter we're having in Australia.My only gripe is that the performance seems to be pretty bad... Either I'm going noseblind to this SUPER QUICK, or it's just not packing any kind of longevity. 30-60 mins at the max of being able to smell it around me before it dies down and I have to resort to smelling my hand like a weirdo to get my hit.I'm hoping this is because it's a new release and needs more time to mature and macerate and not a case of weak Initio formulations? It's disappointing because the scent itself is almost perfect to me, but I'm not getting any performance out of it. I'd be totally fine with 3-5 hours with this, so I'm tempted to let it sit on ice for a while and see what happens.EDIT: Okay so this has had some time to macerate since I wrote this review originally and I've upped the amount of sprays to about 5-7 (I'm pretty conservative normally, 3-4 sprays of anything max) and I get much better longevity and performance now. A lot happier with this now, the fragrance is just amazing."

If you know the chocolate sweets with hard liquor and cherry inside this is what it reminds me of, but also wrapped in top-shelf tobacco and sprinkled with pink pepper for that extra touch of wildness which makes it super addictive and sexy. Sadly can't really use it since it's summer and the smell is too warm and sophisticated, but still can't get my nose off it. The price might seem a bit steep for some, but this is not just your another date night perfume, as some comments stated. I see this perfume as a piece of art and one's personality's representative, which means, I would say it's pretty reasonable to wear it at any time you like if it's cold season (NOT AT THE GYM), just be careful with this if you have a shy personality, because it sure makes a statement. Definitely one of those perfumes that could wear you instead of you wearing it, so not a safe blind buy. First 2 hours are room filling, then next 6-8h after that the smell could be felt easily at arm's length."

I didn’t love it at first. First 2 wears it wasn’t really what I was expecting, it was mostly a TOBACCO PEPPER Bomb, with a hint of cherry. I stg it was 40% pepper, 40% harsh tobacco and 20% vanilla and cherry. It was a huge disappointment, specially because side effect is my favorite fragrance. I let it macerate for 2 months and Jesus Christ, now is one of the most beautiful scents I’ve tried. Syrupy cherry, with a hint of tobacco and a boozy vanilla dry down, it’s just such a sexy fragrance. If side effect is a 10/10 this is a 9.5. The most beautiful dark cherry fragrance I’ve ever tried, just let it macerate."

I owe Narcotic Delight the sincerest of apologies. I viscerally hated Narcotic Delight the first time I sampled it back in late January. However, after hearing consistent feedback from a few trusted noses, I decided to revisit it. I am not sure if the sample I had was dud or if they corrected some batch issues, but this is a COMPLETELY different fragrance from when I first got my nose on this.The drydown on this is phenomenal, 2 sprays and 4 hours later Narcotic Delight has settled into the most gorgeous boozy vanilla. There's something honeyed in the background as well though honey is not listed as an official note. Whereas Side Effect is cozy glass of rum by the fireplace, Narcotic Delight is a straight up sexy and confident dose of boozy vanilla versatile enough for the office, or an evening out. I would actually class Narcotic Delight as a sweeter, smoother and more versatile version of Side Effect.I am curious to know if anyone else feels like this is a totally different (and better) fragrance from the promotional samples and initial release batches? Or had a bad sample...Editing to add: Found the sample while cleaning and it was definitely a dud."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Initio-Parfums-Prives/Narcotic-Delight-89368.html,Narcotic Delight Initio Parfums Prives perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"The opening to me this is very similar to Herod by Parfums De Marley. It's not a clone by any means but side by side it's very similar. By the dry down it goes in a slightly different direction but if you have Herod already you may want to buy a decant / small sample of this to see if it's different enough as I would find owning the two of these redundant.How would I describe this fragranceIt starts off sweet and spicy, a cherry cough syrup like opening, everything goes together, it's not a huge blast of vanilla or anything you can pick up without checking out the note pyramid everything is blended together in such a way nothing sticks out. The cherry cough syrup is not like if you cracked open a bottle of nyquil but it can be somewhat medicinal. If you've tried Herod by PDM or Guerlain Ideal L'Homme EDP you know what I mean. Either way the opening is the star of the show. Thankfully it isn't Paco Rabanne One Million sweet.As it dries down you're left with this warm, bitter, stickiness where most of the sweet notes of this have disappeared. I'm no perfumer but I imagine it's just the tobacco and spices. This will be a great winter fragrance due to the warmth in the dry down.If you're in a discount perfume store and want to smell something very similar to see if it's worth your time for even a decant of narcotic delight. Try the clone of Herod by Alhambra - Hercules. If you like that you'll like this.Performance and longevity are great, I remember putting five sprays of this on before leaving the house and I'm sure I was making a person or two cough on the bus so safe to say this is beast mode.Would I buy a full bottle? Even if I had millions in the bank, no. I'm happy with 10ml of it. Now if I never smelled Herod / Hercules before I would buy this without any doubt. Thankfully it doesn't smell a thing like Guerlain Ideal L'Homme EDP either so if you own that and are thinking of this they are very different and worth owning both the Guerlain fragrance and either Herod or Narcotic Delight."

My first impression: Boozy, vanilla, spicy (cinnamon?), cherry Coke, rich, decadent, erotic, dark feminine. Wow. I’m surprised that it’s rated as being more masculine-leaning, because to me (on my skin) it smells sweet and feminine, but a mature, refined sort of dark feminine (like Monica Bellucci in The Matrix). The tobacco becomes more prominent as it dries down but it never gets smoky, I initially thought it was leather, and the intoxicating sweet booziness deepens. It opens feminine, but it gets progressively more unisex as the cherry note fades away and the scent gets boozier and deeper. It’s strong and seductive but in a teasing, mysterious way…not nuclear or cloying (obviously it could be if oversprayed, but that would ruin the experience of this beauty).TLDR: Feminine leaning unisex (for the first few hours), sexy, decadent, sweet boozy cherry-vanilla-cola with tobacco and spice. I love it. It’s been almost 8 hours and the scent is still going strong on my wrist, it’s more masculine smelling now. I am looking forward to trying more fragrances from this brand!Update: I couldn’t get over this scent, so I purchased it. I’m obsessed. The first thing I did was slather on VS’s Amber Romance, let it absorb into my skin, then spray this scent over it. It softens the masculine note than comes out in the far drydown."

First of all, it’s far too subdued for me. It’s cherry but not cherry enough. Cognac but not cognac enough. Tobacco but not enough. It feels like the perfumer pressed mute on all the notes to end up giving it a vaguely sweet impression but no impact. It packs no punch whatsoever. Secondly the performance is mediocre. I have to really overspray it to get good projection. I’ve had a couple of compliments (not that I care much) but nobody around me could actually describe what they were smelling. I’ve had “bubblegum”, “a bit fruity” but that’s all. Basically this thing really lacks identity."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Initio-Parfums-Prives/Narcotic-Delight-89368.html,Narcotic Delight Initio Parfums Prives perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I’m pondering how to review this fragrance when I don’t even know if I like the scent or not… anyway, let’s delve into Initio’s new perfume, Narcotic Delight.The opening is basically a Coca-Cola accord, and I mean the Mexican Coke which is way sweeter… such accord comes from combining a softened boozie note, together with the Vanilla, the Cherry, the faint Tobacco and both Peppers.There’s also something much darker and more enticing lurking in the background… unfortunately that heavier warmer darkness never truly comes to the front… it would’ve been amazing if it did.For some reason, Initio decided to soften the Cognac and Tobacco notes, so much in fact that they ended up lacking any presence and just becoming a part of this Cola scented concoction… and I mean, it could be a good thing, I do like Coke… but unfortunately, at some point in the early drydown the Black Pepper kicks in at full force, giving an otherwise sweet perfume, an unnecessary earthy aura… something that seems quite odd in a sweet and boozie perfume.The notes on their own are more or less undetectable, it’s more of an homogeneous mixture of elements, it’s also almost completely linear throughout its duration.Narcotic Delight is very different, kind of a sweet/earthy/dry combo, but at the same time completely within Initio’s wheelhouse, and yes, very similar to others from the brand like Blessed Baraka and Side Effect, just nowhere near their successful scents.In summary, this perfume is not bad, but not that great either.Another problem is performance… it is very present, even after 6-8 hours, but sadly, only to myself. It has no sillage whatsoever nor any projection, and unless people around you smell it directly from you they won’t notice it at all, and this is after overspraying myself and my clothes.People saying that this perfume is a beast that lasts for hours, or that it projects a lot, are lying… definitely try this one out before you buy it and see how long it lasts on yourselves.It’s a fully unisex perfume, appropriate for any occasion, and so soft it would be wearable in any weather, just be prepared for constant re-applying.Disclaimer: this review comes from purchasing a full bottle at retail price."

Keeping my eye out for a good deal on a bottle after sampling in store and then from a decant I ordered. Tobacco, cherry, vanilla and a slight bit of booziness. Performs well, a little above average for me, but I didn't spray too much so I imagine with a couple more sprays it could be even more of a performer. I personally would say it leans masculine, but can be worn by anyone really. A cooler weather one, as you can imagine."

I typically don't go for these types of boozy, deeper scents, I'm more of a feminine/sweet/floral kinda girl. Nevertheless, I enjoy this one because of the hedione! In a nutshell, this is like a slightly cherried cognac, mixed with a vanillic tobacco and then throw in a dose of hedione swirling around on top. The hedione comes in more later. It starts out more spicy, cherry, boozy, then the dry down is tobacco/vanilla/hedione. This is not a cherry bomb thankfully. I am over the whole cherry craze, and it's not a note I love that much.

Initially it doesn't hit you hard, but as the minutes and hours pass, you WILL NOT go nose blind on this one. It is ADDICTING. You will continue to catch sniffs of that Hedione with Vanilla and Cognac that will keep you on your toes.I tend wear very masculine fragances and this one, leans slightly masculine IMO, but, to each, each own. This is truly an addictive fragrance, much like Angel's Share by Killian. I could care less if it projects beast mode or not, this is one that I enjoy wearing for myself.This is Hedione, Vanilla, Cognac, and a slight hint of Tobacco done right."

Althaïr by comparison has a fresh spicy opening by account of bergamot and cardamom and transitions into a dense, sweet base with its praline accord.Narcotic Delight is also a (to a lesser extent) sweet fragrance but the similarities end there. I get the cherry, pepper, cinnamon and cognac. It shares some notes from Side Effect but it’s perhaps a bit more dapper in its tone. If Side Effect is the sweet, loud seductive scent then Narcotic Delight would be the slightly more reserved, suave cousin."

I fooled around and fell in LOVE!!! And this is coming from a collector who has heavily scrutinized and criticized this house.This was an extremely successful blind buy, I must say.

The only note that's the same is tobacco.So it's a strong like but not quite a love, I'm not saying I won't get it but there's at least 2 in front of it. So I get cherry cola on initial spray & then the drydown is very much PDM Althair with just a hint of that cherry/fruity sweetness- they don't seemingly share any notes but that's definitely what my nose gets.I wouldn't pay full price for this at £245 but I could currently get it for £183(discount code) & I might consider that but not right away."

It's not boozy enough to be a boozy fragrance, the tobacco isn't all that noticeable so as to call it a tobacco fragrance, it's just a lot of sticky sweet cherry.I would've loved some more depth and evolution in this, but from start to finish it's very linearly cherry-heavy with a minimal (as in barely noticerable unless you search for it) heliotrope and cognac (which to me smells more like amaretto than cognac). Too sweet for me, and I would've really loved some more balance.Sillage is great, absolutely great, but performance is not that good, 4-5 hours for an edp is not really worth it considering how highly they chose to price it."

I really like this but all I think of when I smell this is those cherry colored wooden chips shaped like flowers. Its well blendedAlmost has a cherry cola feel to it /cherry flav cough syrup. Would I buy this? Yes sure. But for the price? No thanks. There's a cinnamon component in here might be the cognac /pink and black pepper blend. .. as well which screams fall /autumn potpourri vibes just as I mentioned in the beginning of my 1st impression.

In the mids it starts to develop a shisha facet, which somewhat reminds me of the new shisha inspired Kilian (forgot the name).All in all, i appreciate tht it's different from Side Effect and at first i liked it better than SE but then the shisha vibe killed it for me. It is also less synthetic than some of its Initio siblings.Sample projected well off my wrist. Lasted well too i had to scrub it off when i got tired of it.6/10 in my book"

Where as say with D&G the one luminous night I automatically think of side effect. This I dont get it.I was worried about the black pepper in this fragrance, as theres not many black pepper fragrances I can think of that I truly enjoy, but this is not harsh or aggressive at all to me. I hate the sorta generic term of ""its well blended"" since it sounds very pompous to me whenever I hear people say that term, but ill use it here just because reading the notes im surprised at how smooth it smells to me. Who knows maybe its my post covid nose, but im not feeling any real big jolt to this at all. Not gonna get into a full review since again its just a first impression but in terms of the hype its not surprising to me. I think it smells good and generally speaking although I have my own irritation/gripe with the brand itself for other reasons, I cant deny they make a lot of good smelling fragrances."

I was pleasantly surprised to find the Cherry was more dried cherry with cherry booze and set ablaze to reveal a smokey rich depth.The dry down of this smells very similar to Rouge Saray by Atelier Des Ors.

I like the opening but the real love came around an hour later when I became aware of a fresh but non-screechy cherry which is given a touch of spice from the pepper, balanced by the underlying vanilla. I can find all in individual notes in the blend and I am delighted that the cognac doesn’t overwhelm the fragrance (sadly I’ve found alcohol notes overly dominant in some other popular fragrances). I will definitely be getting a full bottle of this and I hope it will continue to deepen and expand with aging as my bottle of Rehab has done. I was fond of that one when I got it a year ago, and now it’s one of my all time loves. Initio really know how to blend a fragrance."

I found it prevailed on my clothes x10 more.There is a waxiness, and it reminds me of crayons. I can smell the tobacco on my clothes, but, like the cherry, it doesn’t stick to my skin, and I have several fragrances where it does last.The overall feeling is nice but a bit too syrupy for me, and I love gourmand.Live Irresistible Delicieuse Givenchy has similar cherry vibes, and they discontinued it.

This is not a typical generic cherry frag.Though I'm gong to have to spend some more time with it to work out if it suits me (I find that is the case most Initio's frags take me some time to warm up to, but when they hit, they hit)."

Cherry, spicy, tobaco, dark, sexy, sweet and divine thing, that also can be worn by women. When compared to Althair, Side Effect or even Herod, then for me it is better (they were a bit more masculine for me). Sorry guys, women also want something sexy to wear :D If you can't handle the sweetness, don't wear it and don't say that it is boring because of that"

This scent starts out with that hedione n cherry for a good 30 mins kinda smells like a few ATH scents at that time but only then. Once the dry down starts to come on the cognac n dusty slightly smoky tobacco pop n creamy vanilla/sandlewood dna Initio is known for. Once it drys down completely you don’t smell a ATH scent anymore at all, you get this beautiful creamy smooth vanilla cherry cognac dusty n slightly smoky tobacco. Very well blended by Initio just like the rest of their fragrances. This smells nothing like Side Effect and Narcotic Delight is much more of a unisex scent then Side Effect. Only thing in common with one another is that it’s a boozy scent but with a completely different smell n booze note. All in all I’m not running out to get a bottle but I can see why some would. I will stick with Side Effect n possibly get this one down the road one day. It smell good but I can wait until fall to pick it up if I decide to. That is my experience with Narcotic Delight. Lil pricey but that’s what ya get with higher quality ingredients."

But at the same time it smelled completely different on me than both of the Sales Associates at Neiman's. I get an extremely strong cherry that persists through the scent. The dry down doesn't give me Althair vibes in the slightest. It is significantly different than Side Effect which I also own. (Also layering ND and Side Effect produced insane results even if you aren't supposed to layer two heavy fragrances, SE is light enough to where it works to bring out the best in both).This stuff has been absolutely killing it for me. It is literally everything I wanted Angels' Share to be... a perfectly boozy and classy Amber, a blast of hedione, a masculine cherry with well blended spices and a great vanilla bean (the vanilla isn't even reminiscent of the bourban vanilla in Althair). The tobacco is a cigar style wet tobacco vs Side Effects lighter dried tobacco.Maybe Initio just works phenomenally with my skin. I hear people say that Rehab and Paragon are redundant but they smell completely different on me as well. Rehab (Also layers extremely well with Narcotic Delight) is like a slightly spicy sweet tart, candy goodness, and Paragon is pure uninhibited aromatherapy in a bottle. I wear Rehab out, I wear Paragon to unwind or a movie night with the lady. Scent is such a subjective concept. It's like fingerprints, no two people have the same olfactive system. Some people are always gonna hate it, but I personally have fallen in love with it and I'm glad I tried it and purchased it before reading/hearing any of the hype or hate."

It goes to show how much hype really works!I don’t smell any cherry (it must be highly synthetic). Maybe, just maybe, there’s a hint of cherry cough sweet / candy when you’re not thinking about it and you catch a whiff. It smells like a sweet cognac that has caramel and woody notes. Not specifically tobacco. I don’t think it’s remotely worth the price, it feels like Initio has smelled some recently successful designer fragrances and tried to cash in on the action, but the party has already moved on. Not even slightly tempted by this one."

It's even similar to ATH ""Daddy"" imo. Does this smell good? Of course but this is not a must have for me."

On my skin Althair is heavier and Narcotic Delight is more airy and radiant, plus I really don’t perceive much vanilla in ND whereas Althair is basically just a vanilla bomb with slight floral accents and praline. Althair is also much more masculine whereas ND to my nose is right down the line unisex. I just can’t decide if I want a full bottle. Is it really worth it? It’s not challenging but it is slightly underwhelming. Powdery but not powdery enough, gourmand but not gourmand enough, woody but not woody enough. Cherry but not cherry enough. It’s nice but just a bit flat. Initio make me laugh with the hyper sexual branding too, honestly it’s really not that sexy. Nobody’s going to be jumping into bed with you because you’ve got a few sprays of Narcotic Delight on your neck. Seems I’ve come to my own conclusion about buying it…"

That was what my comment was going to be. I got a sample of this at Neiman when I was in Vegas. When I got back to my room I sprayed some on after a shower.

Unfortunately no, smells weirdly sweet (kinda synthetic) and leans feminine for me.

It was 1-3 voted off screen before I brought it to 2-3. Mind you, there's not even an ounce of apple in here, but the cognac-cherry drydown with the sweetness brings that exact same feel. That's also why you see Smoking Hot in the comps.The key differences stem from the opening: Narcotic Delight opens with booziness and a syrupy cherry. But it's still nowhere (!) near Side Effect. Performance is quite poor (moderate-to-weak sillage with 7-8 hours of longevity, mostly sitting intimate). The scent feels more spring-fall as a result of the performance and the comparable (Apple Brandy OTR is a spring-summer scent). Narcotic Delight opened with a clear feminine lean, but transitions more & more unisex. Is it worth your $? Probably not. But it's still an okay scent. 7/10.If you want a similar feeling scent for fall-winter, I'd get Smoking Hot instead. If you want a similar feeling scent for summer, I'd get Apple Brandy on the Rocks instead. Otherwise, I'd only recommend this to brand loyalists."

I get the comparison to Side Effect in the opening, but there is a difference between the two. Where, to me, Side Effect is more on the sweet and light side ND it's sweet and dark. They grow further apart in the dry down to the point where ND smells like a deeper, richer Herod. Really nice full rich cherry pipe tobacco fragrance. I'll update with more thoughts later."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Initio-Parfums-Prives/Narcotic-Delight-89368.html,Narcotic Delight Initio Parfums Prives perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,The biggest let down ever. The notes read like a dream however upon initial spray - I can only describe it as Naxos' trashy cousin that blew their inheritance on failed MLM ventures.All the notes harshly compete against one another just to burn out to smell like a box of old Sun Maid Raisins.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Initio-Parfums-Prives/Narcotic-Delight-89368.html,Narcotic Delight Initio Parfums Prives perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I sampled this today at LuckyScent. To be honest, I am let down. I love boozy tobacco vanilla type fragrances and this house has some bangers. I was hoping the cherry note would make things interesting, but I think that it threw this composition off. Attack me all you want, but on skin, smelling this up close, this does not smell like a high quality fragrance at all. It comes over overly synthetic and like something that comes in a $30 Amazon blind buy. I would much rather buy Kilian Smoking hot over this fragrance. They don’t smell alike, but are in the same hallway to satisfy this itch. This for sure leans way more feminine than masculine with the cherry note. Not jumping on the hype train for this one. Going to be honest and say pass. It’s a shame, with that note break down I was very excited… DO NOT BLIND BUY THIS FRAGRANCE."

I feel like it will sell really well for those that are into more arabic parfumes, because it is strong, has a bit of a personality and is long lasting. My friend thought it was too sweet, but I think it makes it more appealing and versitile by terms of genders. The cherry is not crazy prominent, but the cognac is and the tobacco comes through a bit later after a few hours. I understand the comparisons to both Althair and Side Effect, and it´s also very similar to Noir Exquis and I own all of those so safe to say I like Narcotic Delight as well!"

Not even close, you're reaching lol. Side Effect? I can see the similarities and I think they could be used in the same settings but they are definitely different and you wouldn't be wrong to own both. With that said this fragrance is intoxicating. The wiffs that I randomly get off my skin are so damn good. This is date night for sure and definitely unisex. I would personally love this on a girl. I love the tobacco in this and I wish that note was a little more pronounced. Thats my only gripe otherwise it's a beautiful sexy and seductive scent.

On him, it smells like a luxurious cherry and cognac smell and I actually enjoy it. On me, it is more reminiscent of tobacco and the pepper notes. I am not the biggest fan of it.

Sweet cherry tobacco with an extra punch of hedione lift it to another level. Upon smelling the atomizer alone, I immediately thought of Black Cherry Shasta soda. After spraying it, the cherry quickly took a back seat while the hedione and tobacco moved to the forefront. I don't really notice cognac but that might be due to the exquisite blending of the fragrance. The tobacco is deep, dark and almost ashy but in the best way possible, if that makes any sense. Later in the dry down, the cherry lingers in the background and the vanilla starts stepping forward while that amazing tobacco note continues to be the star of the show. There are some very minor similarities with Side Effect but it's a significant departure. Overall, this is a spectacular release that really blew my mind. It's a love.

This is far removed from a realistic cherry and I must agree with many reviewers below that this is a disappointing waxy cherry candle scent. I have a DW candle that smells almost identical to this scent profile.This is similar to Side effect which I strongly prefer over this offering.

Sense of smell is mostly back at the moment. The cherry is this has to be the most realistic cherry I have ever encountered in a fragrance and I love it. Like juicy, slightly tarte, dark morello cherries delicately steeped in just the right amount of booze. Not sure how but I get a hint of caramel as well. The vanilla doesn't really standout out in this but the combination with this particular cherry is probably giving the impression of caramel to me. I get tobacco leaf very much in opening and the pink pepper but that subsides rather quickly. I struggle with cherry notes as they can come across cheap and tacky or sometimes very almond (I adore fragrances with almond note but when the cherry is almondy I am not too keen) like well you will not find that with this. Overall well blended fragrance longevity is as expected from Intio. Smells nothing like Side Effect btw so definitely worth owning both if you want to add this to the collection. To me it gets ever so slightly gourmand on my skin as time goes by. This is quite dark in terms of impression as well and the type fragrance for intimate settings... It reminds me soon much of something I have eaten and drank but cannot say what. Perfectly unisex."

Cherry, spicy, tobaco, dark, sexy, sweet and divine thing, that also can be worn by women. When compared to Althair, Side Effect or even Herod, then for me it is better (they were a bit more masculine for me). Sorry guys, women also want something sexy to wear :D If you can't handle the sweetness, don't wear it and don't say that it is boring because of that"

Not even close, you're reaching lol. Side Effect? I can see the similarities and I think they could be used in the same settings but they are definitely different and you wouldn't be wrong to own both. With that said this fragrance is intoxicating. The wiffs that I randomly get off my skin are so damn good. This is date night for sure and definitely unisex. I would personally love this on a girl. I love the tobacco in this and I wish that note was a little more pronounced. Thats my only gripe otherwise it's a beautiful sexy and seductive scent. (btw if forced to choose I still have Side Effect slightly ahead). I can see this one being popular for sure."

Until now.Narcotic Delight begins with an aromatic pink pepper, and very cinnamol and eugenol forward clinging to that aromaticm, allowing for the that hint of cherry to pop slightly off the surface.Once that opening tempers, the cognac and vanilla begin to emerge, providing a delicate sweet, boozy foundation upon which the cherry swirls atop.When compared to its boozy/tobacco/cinnamon/peppery/vanilla predecessors, like Angel Share or Herod, to name a few, it is an aggressive competition. I prefer Narcotic Delight in this family. The former turn a bit floral on my skin, and this one does not. It maintains its boozy, sweet cherry tobacco and radiates off the skin like how most Initio fragrances deliver.If you put a lipstick accord in this is would smell like my favorite Maison Martin Margiela discontinued fragrance ‘Lipstick On’.I rarely buy full bottles.This is full bottle worthy."

Potent but not invasive, it is comfortable to wear without disturbing others.Penguin evokes clean, fresh air, reminiscent of a cold, cloudy morning. Easy and very wearable, it is one of the most wearable fragrances from Zoologist. However, I still recommend trying it before buying.It behaves a bit like Musk Deer on my skin (although it doesn't smell anything like Musk Deer) in that I become nose blind to it, and suddenly, a big whiff of Penguin reaches my nose.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Sampling the second most recent Zoologist release, and the first from 2024, Penguin, a perfume that opens as an icy fresh, citric, green, semi ozonic mix that dries down interestingly with spices and resins—namely, juniper, pink pepper, saffron, labdanum—so while it starts out icy fresh, it quickly finds more interesting footing in its more profound dry down. I really enjoy this quick evolution, frankly a bit of a bait and switch, from the icy blast to the spicy dry down, particularly in that where it ends up isn’t overbearingly intense but rather still nuanced and year-round pleasant. I think this leans toward the more crowd-pleasing, say, half of the Zoologist catalogue, while still being quite interesting and innovative. The spice/resin ensemble just clicks very well with me, and as usual, performance is quite good, albeit not as strong as the latest entry, Rabbit.Penguin is sold at the brand’s standard pricing, $175 for 60ml, in 20% concentration (usually between EDP and extrait), by both the house website and boutiques like Perfumology. Like many of the house’s new releases, it’s sold out quickly via a number of points of sale. And the house sells a travel size, too, as it does for most of its scents.8 out of 10"

This opens with a crisp and icy air, it’s biting and sharp but not in a bad way, it’s intentionally cold like arctic air would be. There’s a heavy dose of juniper here too adding an aromatic freshness. The scent goes into a slightly rosy and mildly warmer territory in the heart but still keeps that ozonic freshness. The dry down is a suede forward scent with a powdery sandalwood, with an oh so earthy oakmoss. This is a distinguished little penguin man in a suit jacket that carries around a suede satchel across his chest and a monocle in his pocket. He only ever graces the cold arctic terrain to see his fellow penguins, but otherwise cozies up in his solitude with a good book and a cold breeze."

It doesn't SMELL like Antaeus, but the animalic notes are smoothed out in that gentlemanly style rather than a hyper funky, screechy way.At its core, this feels like they went into it looking to make a throwback scent, stripping away any potential for that hyper-modern sweetness to evolve, leaving me smelling kind of like I did after high school gym class. But like...in a good way, somehow?All around, an interesting twist on a familiar, oddly-pleasant scent. I'll probably just throw on Drakkar Noir instead, but it might be worth snagging a travel spray at some point in the future."

It reminded me of gin with a touch of cucumber peel in the opening, but of course, in a perfume-like manner. Personally, I did not find many parallels with Snowy Owl; both interpret ""coldness"" in different ways. Snowy Owl has a lot more earthy patchouli, while Pinguin is more aromatic. I'd wear it throughout the year; it would be like a sip of cold water in summer, and the cold winter winds make ozonic notes play on a whole new level. I loved it!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This one is just an overprised male aftershave, nothing much else behind itFinished my tester, was quite dissapointed about this one given that I love masculine fragrances a lot"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Penguin opens with juniper berries and Zoologist’s interpretation of an “ice” accord, which, to me, reads more as water. The juniper is very reminiscent of Orpheon’s opening. But whereas Orpheon goes powdery this goes soapy and clean. I liken it to showering under a waterfall in the forest. You do get the ozone and moss, before the suede really shines through in the dry down.I think Snowy Owl was more successful achieving a “cold” smell, whereas Penguin is more aromatic. Nevertheless, it’s a great scent. It’s on the masculine side of unisex, but it is definitely unisex. I get about 5-6 hours of wear on my skin."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is lame for zoologist. Go to the beach, rub a piece of damp driftwood on your arm, and this is what you’ll smell like."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Just call this Ice Spice. Depending on the whiff, you can get either fancy aftershave or peppery, gin-forward iceberg. For me, this is what ""blue"" would smell like, but a decidedly arctic and primordial impression of it. Unlike some other ozonics which just feel too clinical on the skin, Penguin actually inspires emotion. It may not be the cuddliest fragrance, but there's a perceptible ""aliveness"" to the scent as each note develops shape. I could see myself reaching for this when the temperature outside begins to drop and the wintry atmosphere creeps in."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"One of tame Zoologist creation. For us the zookeeper or collector, its a bit of disappointment due to designerishness. However, it is still OUTSTANDING. And still we will keep penguin in our fragrances library. Easy to wear, easy for compliments. Performance is quite good, not as great as others. I prefer Penguin than Panda or other tame animals."

And it isn’t ozonic neither aquatic to me at all."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"These user reviews and even the brand’s marketing descriptions are getting so ridiculous and embarassing. There is no such thing as an “ice accord” or a “fresh cold air accord” lol. It’s just getting embarrassing. The only way ice or air have a scent is if it is tainted with something else stop with the whimsical bs!!!That being said, the best way I can describe Penguin in layman’s terms would be fresh laundry on top drying down with a hint of smoke and the slightest tiny bit of sweetness that is barely detectable. The smoke is a bit offputting as it somewhat resembles hickory wood smoke that you would use to smoke meat with. This fragrance is slightly weak on projection and longevity. Very over priced imo 6/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Extremely hard to wear as the scent is so strong and obnoxious. It can give you a headache so I would recommend a single spray.

What to say 🤔 It is a the most inoffensive scent I ever was wearing .I get a blast of fresh cold air it's a very realistic feeling. Little pepper and saffron. Leather note is a very prominent on my skin. I find some woodenes and moss. Office friendly scent. Projection Close to the skin, longevity max 6-7hors.Penguin talk about Artic feeling environment very monoton. Interesting realistic interpretation of that.Like but not love it"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"A beautiful scent, especially the opening (which I wish lasted longer). I agree with other commenters saying it smells like the back of a fridge (in a good way!) and that it is definitely one of the more wearable Zoologist scents. Very wearable, but still unique. Penguin seems to be a scent that's underwhelming for seasoned Zoologist fans and avantgarde lovers, but a hit for those who are starting to dip their toes into more experimental scents. It won't be a signature scent for me, but I appreciate having it in my sample collection."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Strange. Cold, spacious and fresh with lots of medicinal saffron and spices. A lot of mossy/grassy backbone with a lot of aromatics (Vetiver?)"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,It smells like Cif - the cleaning product. Also the smell of condensation on the back wall of a fridge.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Wow! Such a beautiful fragrance, something about the slight woodiness and the airy notes almost reminds me of flipping the pages of a magazine. It smells like an expensive spa, a nice hotel, a classy man or woman. I’d say this perfume is truly unisex, I could also see it working in any season. It’s incredibly universal and wearable while still being unique and intoxicating. I could see this as being a safe blind buy for those who enjoy fresh fragrances. This is the type of fragrance that could work well in an office environment as it is pretty inoffensive. I’ve only worn this in the heat so far due to my climate but I’m excited to spritz some on me in the cold, see if I get any of that ice note. Very long lasting so value is there for me, I don’t see myself as having to reapply this during a long day. Stuck on my top for 12 hours, was getting whiffs of it throughout the day. All in all I can’t say enough good things about Penguin. This feels like a new signature scent for me!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"When I first saw the label art for Zoologist's Penguin, I’ll confess there was a part of me that thought, dang, I really hope this smells how the grizzled and extremely unhinged Willem Dafoe looks in Roger Eggers’ The Lighthouse. Of course, anyone who saw that must know that I am mostly kidding (although perversely, I am not totally kidding), and instead of an olfactory tour de force of maritime menace, unfettered madness, and the salty tang of brooding, brine-soaked despair, we get the mythical chill of Frosta, She-Ra's Empress of the Snows on the fantastical planet of Etheria. An invigorating blast of frozen air, crisp and clean, a tonic bracing and bittersweet, a glacial window to the indifferent beauty of the bone-chillingly wintry landscape. An ember of pink pepper trills tremulously through juniper’s whispers of icy ancient pine; saffron reveals the warm honeyed spice of its mysteries only to become lost in the cool, unknowable depths of sea moss. And yet… there’s a stormy heart to this scent, of musk and rain and the desolation of sirens and the destruction of sea gods. Perhaps that gnarly lighthouse keeper has a place in this planet's story, after all. I’m not sure what happened to the penguins, though."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"An icy blast of an opening, refreshingly bright, cold, bracing without over-challenging. The juniper herbiness is sublime, sadly short-lived. Dries down warmly with cosy, musky, woodiness saved from banality by a vaguely tobacco suede note. Very accessible and wearable imho, I have decimated my small sample and have a bottle on back order - can’t wait!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Certainly the most wearable zoologist fragrance. I always appreciate the artistry behind their work. The suede note is quite prominent for me, and the suede reminds me of bleecker street by bond no 9. JUST the suede note reminds me of of it, not the whole fragrance, so don’t come for my head.I enjoy this fragrance much more the longer it’s on. Smells much better in the air than up close. Leans slightly on the mature side for me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Penguin actually smells cold! It has a slight cologne aftershave smell but in the best way! It hits you with a cool juniper berry and some sort of mint menthol that reminds me of cold air. The pepper is nice for an added depth as if the cold air is prickling your nose. It is all carried under a soft sandalwood musk that reminds me of a wooden boat this penguin captains. It’s quite a nice scent that feels very much like being on a cold arctic sea. It’s very nice just to experience it and the nicest thing is zoology sent me this as a free sample with my others which was very generous and kind of them. 💕 I would recommend at least a sample just to see how cool (no pun intended) this scent is!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Opens with what it promises, the feeling of very cold dry air. This is pretty awesome but it does fade very fast.After this it's lots of the pepper and juniper and what feels like a strong ginger like note along with maybe just a little bit of essence of carpet cleaner solution, a definate undercurrent of synthetic cleaning product here.Really nice unique fragrance overall though at this stage, I wish it stayed this way for the rest of the time.The dry down is basically very dry moss and a smidge of leather feel, some sparkle from the juniper and dry woods. Going into a more cheaper mens aftershave territory here.I like this, I'd say it fits the animal well I just wish those open stages would stay around longer as they are unique moments but the rest of the journey is only OK.Pretty safe, although I suppose some people might find the opening (South) Polarising."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"As far as zoologist goes, this is very wearable, but not quite as unique or expirimental as I'm used to with the brand. If someone had told me that it was a designer fragrance by Versace or Dior, I would have believed them. Fresh, clean, surprisingly sweet and classy. It's intended to be a winter scent, but I honestly think I'd rather wear it to ""cool down"" in the summer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"perfumers need to understand that for a cold effect (menthol is one of the first choices) its cold without being minty. when i think of a penguin and its enviroment, ill add muguet materials, bit of geosmin, and watery sea materials. then u have penguin. thats what happends in marketing, sometimes the allure is too much for a misleading discovery. ahh well artic penguins are eating fish and traveling happy right now. hugs and kisses dear comrades!!!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is very aquatic, earthy and subtle. There’s no shock to your system, like an Antarctic plunge. I wish it was more bold, frigid and frozen. But it’s very delicate and docile. Almost too delicate. Creamy aquatic with citruses. Not super impressed. Though, it lasts and it smells more so cold than warm (like seahorse). This is a winter, more fresh and soapy and citrusy version of seahorse (and more quieter)"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"The more I try the fragrances of Zoologist, the more I am convinced this house is taking the piss out of people.Penguin is basically ""Squid-lite"", a bit of pepper and a slight glue accord and that's it. No performance, no silage, this is just a straight up joke.I feel mildly insulted, having paid for a sample of this garbage.I am done with Zoologist."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Penguin is very soft and subdued. I smell the suede most, reminding me of what a smoker's clothes smell like. This is not an enjoyable note to me sadly and it kind of ruins the experience of wearing this perfume. I don't want to smell like a smoker. I get the icy feel in the first few minutes, but it doesn't last. Overall I think my expectations might have been too high.The rest of the fragrance is ok, but I can't help thinking this is exactly what an ''Arctic Air'' candle or hand soap from Bath and Body Works would smell like. This is not good for a perfume at this cost: it smells cheap. You, as the wearer of the perfume, will know that you're wearing a niche, expensive fragrance, but I bet anyone who would smell you would think you put on a cheap body spray."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"As a huge Zoologist fan, I had sky-high hopes for Penguin and had been eagerly anticipating it since its announcement. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a scent that was akin to taking a polar plunge and emerging from the blue glacial waters – lips purple, draped in sea kelp, and shivering as you claw your way onto an iceberg. Or mixing myself a chilled gin martini, ripe with juniper notes, while wearing a tuxedo (or as one might say, a penguin suit).This was…not that.At first spray, I couldn't smell it at all. Then it began to blossom, and I couldn't quite put my nose on what this smells like. To me, it doesn’t smell like the frozen tundra so much as it smells, I’m not sure…sterile? Empty? Lonely? It smells crisp in an odd way, and on my skin it smells almost like…glue? Perhaps the notes blend together too expertly, because I can’t pick out the ice, nor the juniper berry, nor the saffron, nor the sea moss. I don't dislike it, but I don’t know what to make of it, either.I remain mildly disappointed after hyping myself up with my own (perhaps unfair) great expectations. I’ll likely end up eating these words, as some Zoologist bottles are an immediate love at first spray, and others like Penguin are so confounding that they eventually grow on you. But if you’re looking for a wintry scent, I would suggest that you first take flight with Zoologist’s phenomenal Snowy Owl rather than its confused Penguin.In five words or less: The iceman confusingly cometh."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,The juniper and moss stand out the most to me. There is also a strong soapiness.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Not bad but also not super impressive. It smells very fresh, almost like a minty sort of fresh and it's reminiscent of a pine tree (probably the juniper and moss). It's also kinda soapy (?) there's something off-putting to my nose, almost metallic (?). Difficult to describe, as other Zoologist fragrances. I will say though, I feel that it's more masculine leaning than unisex."

(Almost like irish spring soap and calone, but not as angry) It did give off icy vibes. I love the freshness of this. In a bit is cooled down to a soapy freshness that could be thought of as cold, icy. I did not get any of the middle notes, but I am starting to feel the moss. This is really nice. I am waiting to see what the final dry down will beupdate:This stuff is endless. It lasted over 10 hours. Though it gets very soft near the end. (you need to stick your nose close to get any..) I got that fresh soap thing and sandalwood. It was very lovely on the dry down.Very nicely done for me.I really want to get a FB (having purchased travel size, and reaching for it quite often).

I've had my sample for some time (kindly provided by Victor with my last order) and I've had time to wrap my head around it. I think? It's such an unusual bird (pun intended). Those who complained Zoologist were getting more ""mainstream"" will be served: this is Zoologist at their best! Evocative, singular and complex.On the surface, this is a freshie, crisp and sharp, dominated by notes of juniper and I believe cistus (which brings an herbaceous, woody tone). What truly breaks my brain and bugs my mind is the ""ice"" and ""Antarctic air"" accords. I honestly shook my head and thought ""alright, you guys are pushing it here""... but immediately upon smelling it, you really pick up a weird ""coldness"" from it. I can't explain it properly, it's just a very weird sense of cold, like if you open your freezer and breath in deep (not food, obviously) or when it's -40 outside and the air has that briskness that takes your breath away. That. As someone who is not into freshies, I was a bit perplexed but also intrigued and it turns out, on skin this develops quite a bit.After the initial opening, I start getting a bit of warmth, a little coziness which I'm guessing is brought by the middle notes. You feel like you're the little chick being buried under the feathers, it's warm, fluffy and soft. Besides the feeling of briskness in the opening, there is nothing harsh about this Penguin. That fluffiness lingers on through the whole longevity (I'm guessing from sandalwood and musk?) and you get that typical ""Zoologist bird"" vibe, that familiar ""featheriness"".Surprisingly, this lasts well over 6 hours on me, which is very unusual for a ""freshie"". Also, this is indeed an aquatic but not the typical sense, not your average ""beachy"" aquatic. This is arctic cold. As it turns out I've also noticed that somehow, it survives the cold outside surprisingly well. What wizardry is this?! Truly a great job from the perfumer here. This is obviously good for wintry weather and I would say through early spring. I'm not sure how it will fare in Summer and I don't think it's a good fit for Fall, as it is very ""airy"".

This actually does smell like where a Penguin lives, even just at the zoo, but its done in such a wearable and pleasant way that transports you to that place. Unlike a lot of other Zoologists, there isn't much animalic or ""earth"" accords to it but it just doesn't smell like anything else.Amazing!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zoologist-Perfumes/Penguin-88917.html,Penguin Zoologist Perfumes perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"As a huge Zoologist fan, I had sky-high hopes for Penguin and had been eagerly anticipating it since its announcement. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a scent that was akin to taking a polar plunge and emerging from the blue glacial waters – lips purple, draped in sea kelp, and shivering as you claw your way onto an iceberg. Or mixing myself a chilled gin martini, ripe with juniper notes, while wearing a tuxedo (or as one might say, a penguin suit).This was…not that.At first spray, I couldn't smell it at all. Then it began to blossom, and I couldn't quite put my nose on what this smells like. To me, it doesn’t smell like the frozen tundra so much as it smells, I’m not sure…sterile? Empty? Lonely? It smells crisp in an odd way, and on my skin it smells almost like…glue? Perhaps the notes blend together too expertly, because I can’t pick out the ice, nor the juniper berry, nor the saffron, nor the sea moss. I don't dislike it, but I don’t know what to make of it, either.I remain mildly disappointed after hyping myself up with my own (perhaps unfair) great expectations. I’ll likely end up eating these words, as some Zoologist bottles are an immediate love at first spray, and others like Penguin are so confounding that they eventually grow on you. But if you’re looking for a wintry scent, I would suggest that you first take flight with Zoologist’s phenomenal Snowy Owl rather than its confused Penguin.In five words or less: The iceman confusingly cometh."

It only took about 15 minutes to change into the makeup powder scent, but I didn't enjoy that waiting period at all.I like my fair share of seemingly odd, ""random thing"" scents, so don't hate me for the comparison, but I don't judge anyone who loves it: this is that ubiquitous pink liquid soap from public bathrooms here in the US (>0<)The top notes *only*!Like I said, that fades well before even a half hour has passed, but still....I just can't shake the association.Besides, I've also already met with other scents from this category that mimic makeup/lipstick just as well, but without the initial sweetness (or at least a more pleasant sweetness)."

Problem is for the prestige and price of Chanel's exclusive line, we'd love to see more than ""cute"".Not all that that similar to L'instant magic in smell (apart from being a powdery musky iris) but it does have a similarly pleasant and innocent vibe."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Do you like melonic or aquatic perfumes? This may be your thing. It has a vague Chanel-esque something in there - probably just aldehydes though.Despite being a huge fan of iris perfumes - anything iris-centric is usually a pleasing perfume to my nose - this just doesn't speak of that softness or elegance.In short: Dreadful. Is the name a reference to prefume that's created by a committee meeting? This is not what I've come to expect from Les Exclusifs - I llike or love most of them, with Bois des Illes probably being a top favourite and Misia being a very easy like.I also enjoyed the Eaux perfumes, particularly DeauvilleAh well."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This perfume is lovely! As an iris fragrance lover, I'm a bit biased, but Comète goes in a direction I adore: soft, refined, luxurious, and easy to wear. It makes me feel both comfortable and elegant.On both skin and blotter, Comète opens softly—smooth, airy, with a touch of almond-like bitterness, balanced by dry iris-suede notes. The heliotrope adds a sweetness rarely found in the Les Exclusifs line. The iris reminds me of No. 19 Poudre, with aldehydes adding a light, airy touch. The violet note feels reminiscent of Misia, another Chanel favorite with a ""lipsticky"" vibe.This fragrance is more potent than some in the Les Exclusifs range, though not as strong as Le Lion or Cuir de Russie. It lasts 7–8 hours on my skin, evolving beautifully throughout the day, with moderate projection (half-arm's length with two sprays). To me, it leans more feminine.I rate Comète 7/10. While not for everyone, its quality is undeniable.For iris lovers, I'd give it an 8.5/10. It’s elegant, timeless, cozy, and rich—simply delicious.Con: It’s quite expensive."

I don’t know why, but in my mind this is someone who is lonely like a comet up in space, hence the name, but is always leaving a trail for everyone to see. An iris bomb, cold cut, loved the blossom note that is noticeable throughout. It sometimes leans into plastic territory. However, a good one from the house."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"What comes to mind is la petite robe noir from Guerlain. I read somewhere that the inspiration behind creation of lprn by Thierry Wasser was Coco's little black dress. Comète I feel is Olivier Polge's attempt to reclaim that idea with his own twist in his own way as also to redeem himself of the vast criticism of reformulating the les exclusifs from edt to edp. Jacques Polge's edts, as consumers and connoisseurs repeatedly pointed out, were ephemeral and their reformulations into edps were very poorly done. So after le lion, Comète is equally goood. And I feel the optimism in it.It's about the cherry and bitter almond notes here. Opening is very intense and like guerlain's lprn it too has that sparkling quality. The dry down is not very complex though. Begins to settle down quickly as a powdery sweet violety floral scent.The biggest issue right now is not whether the fragrance is good but whether it is as good as its price."

But mainly I am getting almonds ! Then somewhere in the background Iam registering heliotrope . BUT what gets me is the dry down !! It is some sort of sweet vintage lipstick and for some reason I am imagining a beautiful elegant lady wearing a high quality cotton sweater in light cream color , sunkissed blond hair drinking her latte somewhere on the terrace. So cozy and clean and rich scent . Delicious"

Love in Black Violets and leather.Comete is too fluffy and polite.2 hours later, the Comete scent bubble I was in stops sparkling and sits very intimately creating a quiet fluffy musk on skin.It’s a positive first impression still unsure if it Full Bottle worthy for me.The issue is Comete is Aldehydes. Heliotrope. Violets.If I want Violets and Heliotrope there are better (more affordable) fragrances- L’heure Bleue or the modern version L’heure de Nuit(which last longer and is even more of a marshmallow fluff puff than Comete)Even La Perla White Iris does Violet, heliotrope and musk better- 100 Ml $80-$100.That’s the issue.I don’t know if the addition of Chanel aldehydes to a familiar Violet/Iris heliotrope makes it full bottle worth at $375 per 75ml."

It smells vintage and quite beautiful quality.Although i don't define the gender of fragrances, but this one in particular I think it's leaning more towards feminine and i believe it's because of the sweetness that comes from the cherry blossoms that rises after a while on skin.

Problem is the dry down, which is not my favorite thing ever. It is weak and musky, and unremarkable as well.

I have tried La Peau Nue and definitely prefer this to that, it’s overall more modern but still a traditional powder. But deep dry down does shift and becomes more cherry blossom."

As it settles, a heart of cool metallic accords and delicate florals emerges, creating an intriguing juxtaposition of the cosmic and the earthly.The base notes reveal a warm, woody foundation with hints of amber and musk, grounding the fragrance while maintaining its otherworldly character. Comet's sillage is moderate, leaving a subtle yet memorable trail, much like the tail of its namesake.Longevity is impressive, with the scent evolving beautifully throughout the day. Suitable for both casual and formal occasions, Chanel Comet is a versatile addition to any fragrance collection.While the price point is premium, as expected from Chanel, the unique composition and high-quality ingredients justify the investment for fragrance enthusiasts seeking something truly special."

There's also an ugly musk in here that makes it dangerously close to what I recognize as feminine hygiene products.Some Chanel exclusives are able to justify their price. This one cannot. Get Lipstick Rose instead. Better yet, get what Chanel's been after this whole time - Apres l'Ondee.Update - tried this again. Worse than the first time. I own and appreciate numerous other Chanel 'Exclusifs' and this is just shameful. Something you expect on the wall at Sephora, not at $500 USD/big bottle. If you recall, these were $175 USD/big bottle when they were released in 2007. That's more than inflation, that's downright robbery for this quality."

She reminds me of Guerlain, especially French Kiss and L'Instant Magic. From Chanel, of course Misia.Comète is not for loud statement. Like Beige, it gives me relaxed cozy feeling. Think about a quiet space in modern minimalist house, a soft murmur of elegant people. Think about the highest quality beauty powder in the crystal box, its texture is so soft, almost buttery. The touch of a fluffy puff against your skin. A cloud of ballerina pink powder. It's the way Comète smells like."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Today, tried it again in the boutique (for the second time), and I finally get why people love this.I collect the Les Exclusifs (like a madwoman) and this one is unique enough to own separately.Yes - it's not a Le Lion or a Coromandel - this is the typical Chanel classy-feminine-elegance without being polarising.To me, this actually smells more like almonds/marzipan (but not too sweet), more than cherry blossom. The iris is also very prominent here.To me, this smells like a mix of a few other Chanel scents:- The iris here smells like the iris in No. 19 Poudre, not the dry-rooty-iris that you get in La Pausa.- The violet here smells like Misia, but a bit more bitter (cool!!!) than the fleshy roundness of Misia. Imagine the bitterness of No. 18 (EDT) with the violet in Misia. Misia smells like lipstick and makeup powder. Comete is surprisingly bitter and almondy, which is really nice.- Dries down to this super fluffy, soft musk. You can almost feel the cushions in how soft this musk is. (Not the same musk in 1957 - which while I love, doesn't have this ""pillowy"" feel)I know people are saying it's ""generic"", I would disagree in my experience. The ""generic"" equivalent of the Les Exclusifs range of perfumes are #1 Beige and #2 Gardenia. Not a fan of those either - but thankfully, this doesn't resemble either of them in the slightest. But this one is really interesting. It's bitter, sparkling, powdery, lightly floral and very classy. Gorgeous.I loved it enough to decide to buy it within two minutes of testing it (at retail price). I've had it on my skin since, and still no regrets.Scent: Fluffy, powdery almond with a hint of bitternessProjection: Arm's length (don't be fooled! This is one of the stronger ones in the Les Exclusifs range!)Longevity: Full dayPolarity: Leans slightly feminine, but my skin actually turns this bitter enough to be almost unisex."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Based on one test on skin, this is like a mix between Chanel no 5 Eau Premier and Chanel no 22, which I both love. I am a huge fan of Insolence by Guerlain as well, and Comete borders on that violet/iris territory, as someone mentioned earlier. The reference to Parisienne by YSL is also fitting, but where Parisienne is cool and metallic Comete comes across as warm and textile-like. The dry down is a quite generic skin scent, but with class. Like a high quality sun lotion. Wish it wasn't so pricey though, since I could defitively see this becoming a summer signature scent. I will keep my eyes open for second hand bargains."

I mean, yeah it has some other things going on, and it's obviously well done, but it doesn't have the layers of depth of other Exclusifs. I guess it's just meant to be nice and pretty, foregoing the typical sophistication, which is also super valid - I also like to just feel girly sometimes. It's just that apart from Misia, it doesn't really fit with the rest of the line. A powdery cute fragrance that I find would fit more is actually Ex Nihilo Honoré Delights."

The dry and also powdery Iris embraces this accord creating a chanel-ade structure most are familiar with - No 18, Beige, and La Pausa. As it evolves, the white musk accord captures the scent and makes it radiant and long-lasting. Another wonderful additional to any chanel collector."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I, ve just tried Comete. What a lovely perfume! So elegant, so refined. Definitely a Chanel exclusive! Though a bit more simple and less dense than some of the strong oriental or chypre fragrances in the range, this one has the high quality and finesse of Les Exclusifs! The mix of iris and violets is beautiful. It is a walk in a romantic garden. The notes separation is there, changing softly the aroma and showing a different facette of the Comete bijou. It is not a loud perfume, but a gentle one instead. From all the suggestions of the readers here I find it the most similar to L'Instant Magic by Guerlain. From afar they are almost identical. But if you wear them both as I do, I must say that Chanel is of higher quality. Guarlain's fragrance is stronger, marzipan like and sweeter. Comete is more transparent, ephemeral, whispering. Only the base you smell on the next day is a bit plain musky but still it is my favorite new fragrance!"

There is also a scent of vanilla/marzipan that makes me think of Parisienne macarons. As with so many of Chanel's fragrances, aldehydes elevate everything right from the beginning, giving the effect of sipping a very dry champagne.""Comète"" is an otherworldly and enigmatic fragrance, a delicate counterpoint between sweet and dry: crystalline violets and sugared almonds perfectly balanced with the dry dusty iris-suede notes. It is reminiscent of wearing white cashmere in the month of March, something on the cusp of winter and spring, a scent at the edge of snow and flowers. And yes, I can also sense a poetic whirlwind of ""stardust,"" Olivier Polge's starting point for this iridescent fragrance. If ""Comète"" were a piece of music it would be Debussy's ""Clair de Lune"" or ""Ondine.""I have also enjoyed layering ""Comète"" with Olivier Polge's masterpiece, ""Misia."" The effect is quite magical!This is a very chic and elegant scent. Timeless. True to its name, its projection and sillage are stellar. A heavenly fragrance, indeed!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,I was so anxious to try this so I bought a sample on ebay.NOT FOR ME.I guess it is the artificial floral blast on opening.Im a big fan of no 5 and others.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Beautiful fragrance to try, radiating warmth and comfort in its dry down, while having a quick floral flashy start. The musk in this fragrance is milky and rounded with a hint of sweetness and almonds...as time goes it turns into a soapy skin smell."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This made me swoon. The fruity opening, the powdery dry down. But true to its name, it’s gone in a flash. If the longevity was better I’d be running to to buy a bottle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is an excellent synthetic fragrance. I absolutely love it. Reminds me of YSL Parisienne which is one of my favorite synthetic perfumes of all time. Comete is slightly sweet, slightly floral and 100 percent beautiful. Still has a little bit of that Chanel DNA. Good longevity. Great unique new release from Chanel."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"A new release from Chanel is always of interest to me, Exclusif or not. However, Comète is a little underwhelming, albeit likeable. It is an elegant powdery floral scent, unsurprisingly very Chanel in style, featuring iris prominently alongside aldehydes and musk. It is fairly simple but pleasant, reminiscent in parts of several other Chanels, i.e. No. 5, No. 18, No. 19 Poudré and No. 22. However, its performance is lacking and it runs out of steam into its second act after a promising opening.Comète opens with powdery iris, refined and green-tinged à la No. 19 Poudré. The aldehydes follow closely, adding just the right amount of airiness, not soapy or squeaky-clean, but infusing the iris with light.As it develops, the featherlight heliotrope adds its characteristic hazy almond quality, complementing the iris and aldehydes perfectly. The cherry blossom note follows after a little while, but it is quite subtle, and clean musk underscores this scent with softness.However, in under an hour, Comète becomes a one-dimensional heliotrope skin scent, with a whisper of powder and musk lingering. Sillage is intimate and longevity is moderate at a push. It is a feminine, transeasonal scent, ideal for everyday use.A timeless, elegant scent that fits in seamlessly with other Chanel offerings, Comète is easy to like, but is far from indispensable, especially thanks to its lacklustre second half. Pretty but pointless. 3/5."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"It's a really nice heliotrope perfume. Unless your heart skipped beats once this sucker spritzed, you can do better with that money, dear reader."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I find this very, very similar to Chanel 1957. Just a sweeter more feminine version of that. Add Slight cherry nuances, heliotrope subtract the pepper from 1957... but all and all it is a musky, dry iris. For the money there are similar or better iris fragrances out there. I really think Chanel dropped the ball on this one. It's not as exciting as I hoped. Is it nice, yeah but for a new release it should offer something more. This is way to similar to 1957 IMO to be necessary in the exclusive collection. You can get the same vibe with an inexpensive bottle of Kenzo Flower. Just layer it with a cherry blossom fragrance and bingo you have Comete. Or a very good copy.Edit: I would also like to add performance on this isn't the best. I'm glad I didn't blind buy this because of all the hype. From the exclusive collection I will stick with Le Lion. Now that is value for $$$. Also, for me this doesn't read like constellations/comets etc. I was expecting something more sparkling. Comets are explosive, rare, mesmerizing, this fragrance isn't. This fragrance is Chanel coasting along, following trends not setting them."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"A little powdery, dated and cold, but it's still beautiful.The heliotrope gives off a pretty almond scent bubble, and the musk is clean and not screechy. The aldehydes are fresh, dialed down, and present well - there's nothing synthetic about them at all. The cherry blossom hangs in for a while too which is nice. Comete is very similar to Guerlain Rose Cherie with the almondy, musky florals.I usually prefer a warmer buttery Iris, but I can still see myself purchasing a full bottle as Comete is a safe inoffensive reach. Were Chanel to make a fabric softener, this is what you would get."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I sprayed this on in duty-free but haven't tested extensively - this is just 'first impressions'. Eventually, in the drydown, this becomes an elegant iris-powder perfume, but the main body for me was just baby wipes scent, albeit a luxe version. I don't mind powdery notes in general, but if they remind me of baby care products and changing tables they're definitely out.P.S. I'm a Chanel fan and appreciate most of the Exclusifs, which notwithstanding the price strike me as high quality and interesting - I'm just very sensitive to baby-care associations."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Never believe the hype. It's not that Comète is a bad fragrance - it's just that it brings nothing new. There already exist countless similar fragrances - powdery, lipsticky, violety, waxy. The addition of sweet heliotrope somewhat elevates a scent that would have otherwise been just a mixture of baby powder and a makeup bag. Such a lack of creativity and originality really saddens me.."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Feeling reckless i did blind buy Comete, I've been in a chanel head space lately, and figured it would be an exciting choice.So far, I'm fairly underwhelmed by it. Perhaps my bottle is too new and needs some livening up, but so far it's a very tame flat soft subtle gentle almondy cloud. Not getting much chanel chic or brightness via Aldehydes. It's more like a Guerlain in its manner. Which is fine if that's what your looking for but i think i had an expectation which is usually a recipe for disappointment. I'll continue to give it a chance, but it's not something I'm excited about unfortunately.I'll update this once I've had a bit longer with it"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is lovely. I agree with the assessments above that the DNA of cosmetic-iris-violet-berry scents like Misia, Poupre D'Automne, Lipstick Rose, and their ilk is here. However, I feel that accord humming somewhat quietly and taking a backseat to a big cherry heliotropin opening salvo which lasts a nice long while into the journey of Comete. That make-up accord can feel rather dry and powdery, so I'll say that the heliotrope bent here gives it a sort of chewy, creamy, Guerlainesque quality which is appealing and brings to mind their first Meteorites perfume. It also opens with the sparkle of aldehydes, all subtly done in a way that lifts without overwhelming--very impressive! Cherry blossoms are fairly muted in their scent...a few have a sort of salicylate, slightly floral breath to them...and I don't really find a realistic rendition of that scent here. I believe the ""cherry blossom accord"" here is really just a way to package almondy/cherry notes (benzaldehyde) mixed with heliotropin. Despite its loveliness, I'd say that Comete not a revelation. If you are a huge fan of the lipstick/orris/violet accord and want to see if this creamy, heliotrope slant to it tickles your fancy--go ahead! If you've found such scents a bit stodgy and offputting, this might be the cuddly version that converts you. For those reasons, it's very much worth trying. I have found my ""perfect"" version of this accord in Nez's Ambre a Levres (which takes violet-iris-makeup and amber-ifies it and leathers it up), so I don't think I will need Comete, but I will enjoy smelling the tester whenever I have the occasion to."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Masterful creation dedicated to the ""Bijoux de diamants"" collection, created in 1932 by Mademoiselle Coco Chanel: collection that included the legendary and sparkling Comète necklace that adorned the neck in an innovative and sensual way. Comète is a dream, a wonderful olfactory, romantic journey under the cherry blossom trees that the Japanese love so much. The pink flowers of Sakura. The perfume is surprisingly realistic, you can almost perceive the dry dustiness of the pollen, the delicate purity of the rosy Sakura petal magically amplified by the unexpected and vibrant aldehyde notes so dear to Mademoiselle, the bold and dominant note of Heliotrope which blends with the dark and nocturnal Iris. Amazing dry down that leaves you breathless. It just needs to be worn and loved. Marvelous."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Amazed by the cosmic powdery joy of Comète and blown away into the outer depths of the solar system by the beauty of this scent. I would highly recommend at least sampling this new creation at your nearest Chanel boutique. Just like a calming breeze, this scent is a peaceful figure in the background, never too near yet never too far at the same time. For the best unboxing/ impressions on this scent be sure to check USmellsGood YouTube channel in which Eugen provides a superb breakdown of the scent profile. Exceptional stuff from Mr Polge, I truly can’t resist more Chanel aldehydes and iris!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I was surprised how much I love this. I just bought a sample because we don’t have a store where I live where you can test it. I paid way too much for a free sample someone probably got with a purchase from a Chanel boutique. That is my stupidity because when I bought another perfume online from the Chanel store, they offered a free sample of this with the purchase. Anyway, I was not prepared to love it. Cherry blossom? I did not really believe I would care for something that featured cherry blossom, but boy is this nice. It is a bit sweet and I don’t go for a lot of sweetness, but this is done in the best way! Then it gets soft and powdery but there is some excitement and fun here and not dusty or cloying like you have been hit in the face with some bath or makeup powder that makes you cough. Somehow, this is like freshness. Then there is a lovely musk that comes in to ground us gently after our giddy flight on this comet! It stays with me for hours and my skin eats florals and fruits quickly. At times it seems kind of purple. Violety? Maybe the purple smell, as if scent were a color, is actually the bright blue that seems almost purple from the heliotrope. Whatever, it is a lovely fragrance. Olivier Polge did something special here. I am kind of sad to like it so well because other Chanels are already breaking my bank and the Les Exclusifs line is spendy! I will have to wait a while, since I have other perfumes on my want list, but I will enjoy my samples to tide me over until I can buy a full bottle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Musk, lots of musk, but good ones. Not the laundry type, that was 1957. Comète is soft sweet musk, very cozy. I agree with the review likening it to Guerlain’s French Kiss, it has a similar close to the skin feel good quality.I can also smell violets, faintly, definitely not as nuclear as Insolence or waxy like Misia.Chanel always delivers class. I’m loving it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Smells like everything in the notes breakdown, but in a candy-like form."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Opens like a Granny Smith apple and then turns into this hospital/shampoo smell. This does smell like shampoo but more like the smell of shampoo and plastered walls after a hot shower...as well as cat litter. NOTHING LIKE MISIA.Like I predicted. A snore.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"To my nose, it's a softer Misia with added vanilla and musk. Compared to fabrics, Misia is a crisp tulle netting while Comète is more cashmere. I love both but Comète is my preference. Longevity isn't too terrible, I get about 3 hours before it turns into a skin scent but that does last. As with many, my bottle is about a month old and longevity has improved over that time. I actually love it now, it's really grown on me. It's a must try for lovers of Iris Poudre too, I think if you love IP, you'll love Comète too. Those who miss Vanille d'Iris by Ormonde Jayne might find Comète is a good replacement for that. I don't always enjoy ' prickly, rooty' irises so a soft iris such as Comète is most welcome in my fragrance stable."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I am wearing it (testing) on my arm so here goes my first impression.For the first hour or so I was constantly smelling hairspray, that must be the aldehydes.Luckily that subsides, and in a later stage I can smell a sweet but also slightly sour candy like note. I know I have smelled something similar and it took me a while to recognise it.Comète in the drydown reminds me of French Kiss by Guerlain. It’s not a dupe, but if you like that soft musky slightly sour hard candy powdery sweetness of French Kiss, I think you will enjoy Comète.I’m looking at the “reminds me of” section and I’m puzzled. Either we all perceive this fragrance waaaay differently or fragrantica is riddled with trolls who add a fragrance purely based on notes without having actually smelled it. I mean, really, La Peau Nue? 1957? L’eau d’hiver?? Beige????????"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I need to test a couple of times more before I form a concrete opinion.First impression, I got Iris and aldehydes. The aldehydes here are not sharp and soapy, which is good. I have a few iris fragrances, but this one is very different than my other iris-dominant perfumes. I think it’s very competently blended.Update: 05/29/2024. I tested this again today. The first second of the opening is beautiful iris. Then it immediately comes other notes. I let it dry for awhile, and there was this floaty iris powder, almost reminiscent of Fragonard Belle de Paris but more complex.But Comete has that distinct Chanel feel but aldehydes dialed down. It’s serenely beautiful."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Comète turns into a skin scent in less than one and a half hours. I cannot understand why anyone would pay 300€ ($325 US Dollars) for 73mL (2.5 ounces) for such a weak scent. Absolutely insane. These disappointing new fragrances really make me appreciate the classics more and more each day.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"What I love about the Les Exclusifs line is that it's a home for a whole slew of wonderful violet-iris scents that can serve as an entry point into their wonderful world. What I've loved most about the whole LE line is that if you have a violet-iris weakness, I think you're guaranteed to find something RIGHT up your alley (I have -- twice!)...From the first moment the scent wafts its way up to your nostril, the iris-aldehydes announce themselves and dominate for a few hours -- by about the 4 hour mark, the drydown enters my FAVOURITE stage, and if I'm being honest, were this stage apparent SOONER, I could very well consider purchasing this. Unfortunately, the aldehydes, heliotrope and powdery notes are just *too* much for me, but I can really appreciate what is happening here. It's done MASTERFULLY and with such precision, I kept finding myself asking ""Am I sure I DON'T want this?!?!?!"" -- but as it is, I have WAAAY too many violet-iris scents, let along all the other accord-heavy scents which simply do NOT get the love they should.If I'm being basic, primal and limbic, it's too 'girly', but smelling 'girly' isn't off-putting for me, smelling violet-girly (or iris-girly) is not something I'm keen on.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I tried in store and my first impression was not very good. There is a note in the opening that I don't like, might be the cherry blossom or heliotrope? I am not sure but after about 15 minutes when the note wore off, I liked it better and it became a soft, aldehyde, very typical of Chanel DNA. For the price tag, ($630 for 200 ml Australian Dollars) I feel I have to be in love with the fragrance so I will keep on trying it to see if it ""grows on me""? I hope so because I love Chanel fragrances especially the Les Exclusifs range of fragrances."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,A nose powder. An eyeshadow palette. Wearing Chanel Comète is like catching a whiff of a freshly opened lipstick. Smells like makeup.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"My Honest Review - Chanel Comète EDP My skin type - warm toned and normal-oily skin. Perfume usually has a hard time projecting on me. My usual preferences: Chanel 5, Chanel 19, Reve D’Ossian.   First impressions: I’m surprised at the initial sweetness of this perfume for a Chanel, it has an almond and aldehyde note in the very first instance with a tiny hint of woodiness behind it.The topnotes: Instant Sweet Almond and Aldehyde. If you have ever put your nose to any apricot blossom or cherry blossom and found that tiny hint of almond - it is this note with a lot of power behind it. In fact, the most realistic sakura scent I have found. Fresh but sweet. And not so sweet that you would confuse it for a drugstore generic pink perfume however; as behind it there is a tiny hint of chanel 19 poudré. A little bit of woodiness along with the classic chanel aldehyde blend.  Later impression: over time the aledhydes fade, return, fade again. During this the heliotrope and powderyness start to develop. It begins to smell more like iris alongside the almond. A lot of other reviews compare it to chanel 19 here or even prada infusion d’iris. But I peraonally disagree. The aldehyde, heliotrope and iris together are distinct. it isnt as woody or green as 19, and to me is not anything like prada. It is light, airy and soft. But still leaves a scent trail here for a few hours.   Lasting impression: Finally it pulls close, after 3-4 hours on me (in late may, hot UK weather). At this point is is an almondy musk. And very close to the skin. If you were to hug a friend now they would catch a whiff as if you had used a very beautiful expensive almond skin cream. The heliotrope still lingers and every so often if a cool breeze comes over me I am hit again with each of the notes. It doesn’t disappears from the skin however. I could still smell it on me 10 hours in when I went to bed, but i must stress that at this point it was a lovely skin scent.  Is it worth it: Ignoring the sunk-cost-fallacy and the fact that I am an avid Chanel fan, I must say at £375 a bottle for 250ml… no, not if you are a casual fan of iris, heliotrope or sakura scents.The smaller bottle - yes! It is a well blended perfume, chanel would do no less. It avoids trends, it is not a powerhouse. It is an expensive french perfume in every sense.Personally note: For me however it is worth it. I love soft and expensive perfumes with delicate artistry. I do not need projection to consider a perfume of high value. But I understand a lot of people do.I would gladly wear this perfume to a spring picnic and I intend to do so."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"It is very soft,nice powdery chanely scentVery strong chanel DNA and then Guerlain meteorites (discontinued) from2000That chanel DNA (aldehydes probably) made it same as many from this line .. so you will smell there Boy, Jersey and so …In back you can get fresh cherrie..it is very soft and close to skin..and that chanel DNA makes it also little bit old smelling that in some point it became like some old cream in skin…But for those who live “by chanel” it can be nice casual scent …but still old woman style"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"How do you add to a collection which already includes all-time masterpieces like No.22, Bois des Iles and Coromandel...some of which are over 100 years old?After Olivier Polge dropped the mic with Le Lion, he returns to more familiar iris here, the note which more than any other runs through the entire collection. I could only describe Comete as a sublime iris, dipped in sweet almond marzipan (heliotrope) and sprayed with aldehydes. It's fittingly Chanel in that I could absolutely imagine Marilyn Monroe wearing this to a glittering Hollywood premiere.Yet there is a touch of gilding the lily here: the beautiful floral heart sometimes creaks under the weight of the slightly overwhelming sweetness of the top notes. The cherry-blossom-musk drydown is redolent with shampoo cleanliness which is likewise a departure for Chanel. This is not champagne sweet like No.5, this sometimes verges into the sickly sweet territory of Hypnotic Poison.I can't say for me this reaches the dizzying heights of the standout players in this collection like Coromandel, 22 or Sycomore but it remains a beautiful, if somewhat safe fragrance to add to the Les Exclusifs."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,I finally got a mini bottle tester of this. Without looking at the notes (yet) it feels aldehydic and powdery (like a signature Chanel vibe) plus cherry almond … almost like a cherry candy or a cherry almond hand cream. I just got it on my skin so I’ll report back. Soft femme powdery light … maybe a bit too powdery for me but TBD!!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I received a sample of this from Chanel, and I am enjoying it very much. I sometimes find fragrances from Chanel a little difficult to wear due to the aldehydes and / or patchouli notes, but this is a beautiful powdery scent that dries to reveal the subtle cherry blossom, quite unlike the overly loud and synthetic myriad of cherry fragrances currently flooding the market. This may be the soft cherry subtle and mature perfume I have been searching for. I recommend caution on application though, two sprays are quite sufficient for my comfort level. More would likely dominate a room and make me sneeze. Less is definitely more."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I wasn't looking for it, but tried it. Immediate impression was of an early 80s Cabbage Patch doll - the soft powdery scent of a smooth plastic doll head. So my first reaction was extreme caution mingled with curiosity, but it was already on me. The magnetic pull of something familiar drew me to the sample of the Coromandel oil, which I dotted on nearby skin. Then I went out into the night, only to keep coming back to the developing scent. It was soft, musky, sweet. But the sweetness was more natural, like petals of a flower, not like sugar or candy or syrup. The Coromandel oil performed nowhere near the powerhouse of its perfume version, so I believe it faded. But what was I left with? I keep going back, and 12 hours later it's still faintly there from a single spray, whispering a powdery breath. If its youth invokes literal imagery of my own, its aging is into something soft, mature and astutely feminine.This chance encounter I've had is likely going to draw me back to the source..."

This is very pretty-especially the opening, where I get a cherry in a marzipan/almond way, then it is a lovely, familiar, powdery iris/heliotrope type of scent. Reminded me all day of a a more light and ethereal Trussardi My Name. Lasted about 6 hrs but I could still get a trace if I sniffed my skin directly, for longer. It’s very pretty, a perfect version of a very familiar scent profile. I will buy a bigger decant when I’m done, but not a full bottle, just due to cost."

I also get that almost ""marzipan"" like quality, which never overpowers the composition, but instead adds a nice depth to it. Apart from that, to my nose, it smells a lot like violets! This is probably just my unrefined nose getting confused by the Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, which can smell either like iris or violet, depending on how it is used. But due to me smeeling violets, Comète relly reminds me of Misia and also Love in Black by Creed. Some people heavily disagreed, others also smelled the similarities. Pretty interesting! Nonetheless, Comète is a marvelous scent, once again: Well done Chanel!"

A bit of that chalky Iris and vanilla of No. 5 L’eau, as well.Opening is a bit harsh, more akin to 1957 in this way, but more “earthy” in an almond-y / soap sud vs. shampoo and less diffusive style.First Chanel to singe my nostrils - a personal issue, I accept.Perhaps if this was a Les Eaux I would be willing to fight through the pain, but the aldehydes in Acne Studios were a bit more palatable - suppose I’ve just got no culture.I’ll just stick with 1957, Poudre, and maybe finally grab that bottle of Jersey.No. 19 EDT and Cristalle EDT were always my first choice over No. 5 and No. 22, so perhaps that offers a bit of insight."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I was so close to blind buying this but I’m glad I didn’t. It is beautiful but not at all unique. I have so many similar perfumes with heliotrope, iris and violet: all the guerlain usual suspects, PT Hiver Heliotrope, you know the ones I mean. It brings nothing new to justify the price. If you are a Chanel fan (which I am incidentally), you might want to buy this anyway, but I know I don’t need it. I wish Chanel would do an amazing rendition of rose and sandalwood it could be great."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Oh this is beautiful! 😍 Started out a bit leathery, I think Iris sometimes gives that out, that scared me a bit since I don't see any leather notes here, but than that note quickly faded. Soft powdery sweetness is perfectly balanced not to cross that sophication line but to stay airy and addicting. I think the Cherry Blossom note was such a guinness move instead of rose, rose can come across a bit vintage and pungent in powdery composition like this or even Violet. Heliotrope is giving out sweetened Almond like note, its not overly musky either. Comete is so elegant, feminine and gentle like mothers hug. Although I see why people compare it to Celine La Peau Nue, they are completely different. La Peau Nue is waxy lipstick like scent, while Comete is all of that I described above. Id compare it more towards the Guerlain L'Instant Magic more than others compared, Id also compare it to Dior Dioramour. Im trying to see what else I can compare it too and to be honest there isnt anything I can think off. This is a masterpiece and I truly believe it will capture many hearts. Mine is one of them already. I think found my perfect feminine powdery scent. Good Job Chanel! Thanks for taking care of us ladies who love out feminine leaning fragrances. my only regret not getting 200ml. Ill becoming back for in the future for sure. I think I finally found my skincare/makeup vibe like fragrance without it being to pungent and powdery.If you love perfumes like Lancome Iris Dragees, State of Mind Creative Inspiration, Guerlain L'Instant Magic, Dior Cheval Blanc, Dior Dioramour, Infusion d'Amande Prada, you need to get your nose on this Comete, you are going to love it!Edit: Oh you guys, how much I wish I got 200ml bottle, its soft projecting and Im going to go through 75ml quick. 😅 but this is definitely Chanel fragrance was waiting for all my life! 🤣"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I was SO eager to try this, having heard it was a cross between Misia and 1957 (a like and a love). But no. Nothing of the sort. A. Ferrera, below, is right: it isn't anything like Misia. Just a big mouthful of marzipan - almondy, syrupy, synthetic maraschino. And then ... nothing. It was gone within half an hour. Which was just as well, turns out this is one of the few Exclusifs that I really, really do not like."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Classic Chanel fragrance. Nothing groundbreaking. Elegant aldehydic and powdery. Not very original. You can upon first smell say it's Chanel.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"First impression is not positive. On the skin, it is a musky floral scent, leaning toward the so-called 'feminine' side, with which I've got no problem. As a matter of fact, I can easily, and do with pleasure, pull off Gardenia and 1932 any time of the year, but what does not agree with me in Comete is the powdery note. Might work for others, but so far it is a no for me. What a shame. Hopefully, my thoughts for it will change in the future?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Comète is a story about texture. It is light as gossamer. It is pink-scented air. It is like a bite of cherry merengue that dissolves on your tongue. It is like dappled light. It is absolutely lovely.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"So beautiful and elegant. This is a very good purple Iris (only the purple ones have this particular fragrance), powdery leather, carefree gum, and something almost solar… it actually smells warm. Not just a successful blind buy but a new favorite!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I knew from the notes, that I had to try this. It is so uplifting, and dainty and dressy and everything I haven't ever experienced before. It lasts all day on me..... I've not worn it out in the wild yet, but plan to very soon. We shall see if there are comments. I am not so fond of cherry smells, but this is so light it's almost non existent. It is just a light vapor of a cherry ghost. The rest, almondy heliotrope, and powdery iris are all working magic for me. It does have a gourmand awareness to it, but ever so light. I am at a loss of words to compare it to anything. I do love most fragrances done by the father/son Polge. I have many Chanel, and I would bet that I've gone through too many bottles to count over the years. Thank you for a beautiful new fragrance. It does fit in well with the lace that is so in vogue for this summer in clothing and accessories. Try to find a sample if you can. xo fellow fragranticaians........"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Got my 200ml yesterday!Finally a new release for Les exclusifs after 3 years I’ve been waited for so so so so long!I can really smell cherry blossom in the beginning very prominent, some said they can’t really detect the cherry blossom??huh🤣 it fades away in 10mins and merges into a soft semi-sweet powdery fluffy cloud I would not say this has the wow factor as Coromandel, 31 rue Cambon or 1957, Chanel chose to release a very safe and very Chanel scent. If you love powdery in Chanel style I’m sure you will fall in love with this as well.Luckily the heliotrope is not that almondy as I have always encountered with heliotrope in other fragrances, it is a bit vanillic and sweet would say it leans a bit gourmandy IMO a creamy soft cozy powder stays all day on my skin!! Have gotten a lot of compliments from the dinner last night all my friends (two of them haha) said I smell good and expensive it’s a like a second skin scent~I definitely do recommend this fragrance to all the powdery lovers, as we all know Chanel has always done powdery scent in a perfect way ~ like they always do 💓 performance is very good don’t have to top up through out the day if you over spray a bit !!Signature scent worthy you wont offense anyone suitable for all weather"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I am trying my sample, and I don’t understand those who say they cannot smell cherry blossoms! This opening is definitely a strong dose of well blended cherry blossoms! I really enjoy this with the powdery florals like iris and heliotrope. The mid reminds me a lot of Blu Indaco which I have. That one is heavier on the yellow florals. This one is less musky in the drydown and more fresh.This is not like Miscia at all which I also have. This is lighter and a bit less serious, and more playful.I would say it is a breath of fresh air. Sweeter than the usual Chanel fragrance and more powdery and fresh. The aldehydes are not too much, but contribute to the freshness. I would say this is powdery, sweet and fresh fragrance. Youthful in spirit, but not young."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I really liked the sweet and tender smell. Chanel’s aldehyde, almond, heliotrope powdery scent and the tender floral scents are all things I like. Everything goes together well. Comete starts with a soft aldehyde and slightly sweet and acid floral scent. Then, it has a textured almond shown then heliotrope. In the first hour, it's reminds me of sakura Guerlain, and Mon Precious Nectar that I cherish, but it's not as gourmand because it has a fluffy powdery feeling. After an hour, the scent becomes powdery musk scent that really close to the skin. like when you put on scented body powder after a shower. Very high quality orris root scent that create the buttery texture from heart note to the buttom note.The perfumer did a great job in creating a delicate and pale pink color scent, without following the common path of cherry blossom-scented perfumes and shower gels you find in stores. Scent structure and texture are simple but clear. As a Chanel fragrance fan and love every Les Exculsifs‘ fragrance except 18 and 1932. I think Perfumer Oliver Polge did a great job on creating Comete. It‘s deliverd. It is great for young lady who like subtly assertive fragrances. But if you don't like the smell of almond and heliotrope, you should test it carefully before buy because Comete may be not for you."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Initially I smelled cherry. Not cherry blossom but cherry. And then it reminded me of Beige, powdery and tropical. Then in the evening I smelled No 19 Poudre. So it’s a smooth and pleasant combination of cherry, Beige and No 19 Poudre. It’s pricey though. Before the 75 ml cost 200 euros. Now it’s 240 euros. Not sure if I’ll get it because I have Beige and it’s similar to that. But I’m tempted.Edit: Today I tried it again. This time I smelled marzipan, almond in the opening which is pleasant and makes it youthful, modern and interesting. It disappeared quickly and then I smelled a gentle version of powdery iris like No 19 Poudre. I like the powdery dry down. But the staying power is weak on my skin. Also, it didn't resemble Beige this time."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Mildly aldehydic top, with a fruity facet somewhat reminiscent of cherry but veering into shampoo. A powdery iris makes a momentary appearance before a dry out of musky, fruity violets. Banal and rather conceptually cheap.It would be unfair to compare to Insolence since that fragrance has a remarkable signature and is instantly recognisable. Comète is not so distinct."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"One of the best recent releases, but it smells like a mix of No. 5 Eau Premiere, Misia and 19 Poudree"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"There is no such thing as cherry blossom-smell, cherry blossoms don’t smell."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Comète Chanel(Store test)Green Iris similar to La Pausa at the beginning then throw in Heliotrope to the mix, make it smooth powdery and sweet, mild waxy feel.Compare to more complex scent scent from the house this is either one dimentional or rely heavily on expensive raw material.I personally think this is overly sweet, but compare to Insolence, that won’t be a case. It’s ok, but I would grab La Pausa…"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,This is the perfume Barbie would wear. And I don’t mean that in a disparaging way. Simply ultra feminine and pink feeling. Agree with reviews below that it is somewhat generic but it is also very pretty and sometimes that is enough.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I will add my first impression of Comete, with a slight disappointment that this is not the modern dreamy Chanel I was hoping for. It starts off very promising, with a true cianide (bitter almond), that bites you and grabs the attention, but mellows fast. My least favourite part is the middle, a generic floral heart that reminds of the Sephora isle of designer scents in fashion, girly and unspecific. In the final parts, it once again morphs into an almost different perfume, uncovering candied lipsticky facets that slowly fade into a L’instant magic vibe. It is almondy, powdery and flowery. I don’t think I will be adding this to my collection and so far it is my leat favourite of the line. Worth to mention it does not smell like a Chanel (for the better or worse).Edit: the second try is even more unsuccessful, although the three phases seem to be blended better now, probably from maturation. I will say it is in the same vein as Dioramour from Dior and Rose Cherie from Guerlain, both of which I prefer. Do not blind buy Comete thinking that you love Chanel and you cannot go wrong with it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Again, Guerlain's reference. Insolence + Apres L'ondee, with touches of 1957 and Boy, Misia of Chanel. I don't understand why they degenerate their new fragrances like Dior's. Dioramour is a me-too and trickle-down copy of La Pausa, but with less quality, and without a genuine Orris root. however, Comete is quite resemblant to Dioramours's hideous powderiness."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Oooh just picked this up today!Anyone else notice the atomizer change? Personally like the new sprayer 🙆
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Doled out 20% of my paycheck on a full bottle after neurotically sniffing the remnants on my wrist for two days (and after two showers!) The cherry blossom lingers for most of the perfume's life, and gets yummier without having to fight the heliotrope and iris for dominance. It's not a melon-y, migraine inducing cherry blossom that borders on sweet pea- it's crisp and inoffensive. Two sprays last me a solid 6 hours, and 3-4 will carry over to the next morning. Slightly almond forward in the first few minutes, but not a nauseating splash of extract, just heliotrope that's been beautifully blended. I wish it was a little bit muskier, but I'm in love with it regardless."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"It's been very interesting hearing people complain about the longevity of Comète because I tested this on bare skin on one arm and Coromandel body oil plus the EDP on the other. Not only did Comète stay on for much longer, it definitely projected more than Coromandel. It had been on my arm from 2pm and even after showering with an exfoliant that evening, I could still smell it without even trying to. The smell finally went away the next morning, but that's only because I had another perfume layered over the area.I was smitten with this at first sniff. The heliotrope is absolutely glorious in this one, but does make it lean toward gourmand with its sticky almondy facets in the opening. I did not find this subtle at all - the aldehydes and florals were very loud and unapologetic and the cherry blossom note was seemed to play more of a supporting role rather than being central to the perfume. It dries down to a comforting, fluffy, powdery scent with the heliotrope still at the forefront.I don't find this similar to Guerlain's Insolence - Insolence is sharper and more candied, while Comète is a bit more on the creamy and incensey side (toasted marzipans?). If anything, Amouage's Lilac Love conjures a closer scent profile similarity to Comète for me. At some point, I was picking out something that reminded me of the rain, but not quite the same vibes as Guerlain's Après L'Ondée.Oddly enough, I was caught in the thick of a thunderstorm upon leaving the boutique and the perfume mixed with the smell of hot tropical rain was absolutely beautiful.Because of how long it lasted on me, I would suggest going quite light-handed on this but many others seem to feel otherwise, so it's still best to try it on yourself before purchasing!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,It doesn't smell like Chanel at all. Guerlain - Is Insolence's winger made for young girls? Pehhh 😏
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"The aldehydes are much more subtle here than anything else in the collection. Soft, agreeable and feminine. The heliotrope isn't migraine inducing or overly powdery, huge win for someone like me (constantly living in fear of smelling like an old woman wearing Red Door.) It's milky and musky, a little smoky and comforting but not woodsy or cloying. Generally I dislike any flowers adjacent to gardenia, including cherry blossoms, but this is beautiful. Smells like how the color pink looks, to put it into perspective. For me, the baby wipe tendency in perfumes often trigger my sensitive nose (ex: I love Ghost in the Shell by ELDO, but the babywipeism is too prevalent) but this hasn't proved itself to be irritating in that sense, and doesn't smell like it at all. It's the safest blind buy in the exclusifs, almost walked out of the store with one today but I wanted it to marinate for a while, as sweet scents tend to go sour when I'm working out."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Fluffy, puffy powder without feeling suffocating. It is not exceptionally sweet, but a little. Kind of basic, but then again it's the example of what other perfumers are trying to do but can't quite get there. They're always trying to individualize it. I keep testing iris perfumes hoping to find what I'm looking for but there's always something offputting - melon-y iris musk (I don't like melon), heavy vanilla/tonka (can be like diaper smell to some), incense that doesn't know whether it's coming or going. So far Prada Infusion d'Iris has got it best. Here in Comete is straightforward powdery iris and just enough cherry blossom. It is very classic Chanel and not groundbreaking, not straying too far from allllll their other powdery/aldehydic perfumes, though I think it's unfair to expect them to fix something that isn't broken.The mental image is of a sparkling, luminous comet obviously, but in the context of the early 1900s, when iris was at its heyday in perfume. Those ethereal paintings of a celestial goddess draping her body from the crescent moon, stars sparkling in the deepest-blue heavens. Yet there is also a pink-purple quality that ties in with the unicorn-holo vibe of this decade and even calls to mind newly discovered nebulae in the background of our sky. I could see myself wearing this to meet up for coffee with a friend I haven't seen in a while. It's the kind of perfume I'm usually wearing (such as Eau Premiere or Infusion d'Iris) when they give me a long-overdue hug and say, ""you smell so good!"" They don't know much about perfume, they just enjoy it and that I can appreciate."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Very pretty, clean and powdery scent. Aldehydes are there but subtle which is how I like them. Not a dupe by any means, but part of it reminded me a little of Guerlain insolence. I definitely overpaid for a carded sample to see what the hype was about lol and I think it’s a nice scent, simplicity done well which is to be expected from Chanel but it’s pretty much a skin scent and it doesn’t have that wow factor for me. 1 hour in and it falls pretty flat and a bit generic, to me anyways and is only noticeable up close to your skin. This is the type of scent I would buy to wear to bed or for settings like being on a plane since it doesn’t disturb much. Office safe and is generally crowd pleasing I’m sure. It’s very soft wearing, no harsh edges but I have many other great scents for this purpose and I also think there are many other great scents out there that are close in scent profile to this that won’t put you out $500+ because this is extraordinarily overpriced to me, hilariously so. Overall it’s nice but very overpriced and underwhelming for what you get."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"It’s very “Chanel”, clean and classy plus the sweet synthetic cherry blossom that makes it different. It’s not Flat at all in my opinion and the dry down is beautiful!! Not a complicated or sensual scent either. I can see a teenager wearing it too. It’s easy to wear and pretty and I’d love to have it.. but i probably won’t have it $$$.."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Very clean and powdery almost like baby’s talcum powder. I like the simplicity and classy feel of Chanel Les Exclusifs but unfortunately this is very flat. Its subdued and underwhelming and really disappointing when compared to the latest Le Lion which was at a masterpiece level. Moreover, the price is really a joke. Flower by Kenzo is a better fragrance in every aspect."

Even though Chanel DNA is there and opening is beautiful, it is only good for one hour max. After that the scent just flattens to very generic base and beauty of heliotrope and aldehydes just disappear. Performance is okay but scent wise not even close to the quality Chanel puts out in Les Exclusifs line. Feel like they starting to cut corners in production.As for alternatives to Comete. For the same vibrant flowery powderiness it is better to invest into Bienaime that lasts and glimmers on skin all day with gorgeous facets. At third of price of Chanel they definitely did gazillion times it better."

I can see where you are coming from so now that I have had it and have been wearing it for a few days, I’ll edit my previous post. What I should have said was I agree with many of SD’s points about Comete. However, I do not agree it’s a deep scent, it’s pretty, airy and easy to wear. I do wish the Iris was stronger. I’m not a pro, just a fragrance lover and I love this fragrance."

A bit later it was « Insolence, is that you? » and it finally settles down to an aldehydic musky iris and heliotrope composition, proper and Chanel-like but not much else. I suspect heliotrope, like violet, dulls a bit my sense of smell but the composition is perhaps that simple."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Sounds lovely but not at those prices.. No.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Upon first spray, the scent opens with a delicate cherry blossom accord, thankfully distinct from the typical bath and body works interpretation. While cherry blossom remains present, it doesn't dominate the composition. With time, the iris emerges gracefully, reminiscent of the iris found in 31 Rue Cambon. The addition of heliotrope imparts a creamy quality, edging slightly into gourmand territory. The musk gradually asserts itself and becomes the lingering note for the remainder of the fragrance's duration. While not my personal favorite among Chanel's recent releases, its mass appeal ensures probable success in the market. Overall, I rate it 3 out of 5 stars."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"In the opening I could smell iris, violet and something floral and almondy. The drydown is sweet and gourmand, like violet candies. In my opinion, this is the most mainstream-like and the most un-chanel-like perfume in the current exclusive collection."

I haven’t had luck with cherry blossom in the past, although my experience with that note has been limited to shampoos and BBW products. But iris is a note I’m always interested in, so there’s that.If I love it, I’ll be so excited. And if I don’t love it, my wallet will be so excited! 😆"

If you have the money 💰 you can join the club but if you don't have it that's ok also. Sometimes I like high prices because I won't have to worry about everyone smelling like me. I spent well over 1,200.00 💰 on Chanel fragrances last year for my wife and I because Chanel is my favorite designer fragrance house and I truly love their fragrances because of the quality and how I'm treated when I visit my local boutique."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,I love iris and heliotrope. Very pretty. The aldehydes remind me of the Chanel No5 top notes. But it’s giving Chanel baby wipes. Could be a very safe but very expensive office friendly scent.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Comète is a story about texture. It is light as gossamer. It is pink-scented air. It is like a bite of cherry merengue that dissolves on your tongue. It is like dappled light. It is absolutely lovely.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I had the chance to try it today, it’s very light and feminine, the projection is weak unfortunately but scent is 9/10. I love that Aldehydes are not too present. I can smell more of the iris and heliotrope. I’m definitely getting a bottle"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Dear @l’homminel. I actually did watch Super Dacob’s review before I purchased my own Comete. I respect his opinion on Chanel fragrances. I can see where you are coming from so now that I have had it and have been wearing it for a few days, I’ll edit my previous post. What I should have said was I agree with many of SD’s points about Comete. However, I do not agree it’s a deep scent, it’s pretty, airy and easy to wear. I do wish the Iris was stronger. I’m not a pro, just a fragrance lover and I love this fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Very clean and powdery almost like baby’s talcum powder. I like the simplicity and classy feel of Chanel Les Exclusifs but unfortunately this is very flat. Its subdued and underwhelming and really disappointing when compared to the latest Le Lion which was at a masterpiece level. Moreover, the price is really a joke. Flower by Kenzo is a better fragrance in every aspect."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,A very mediocre floral fragrance by Oliver polge definitely not for men👎 I prefer the works of his father Jacques polge when he was the inhouse perfumer at Chanel!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I will add my first impression of Comete, with a slight disappointment that this is not the modern dreamy Chanel I was hoping for. It starts off very promising, with a true cianide (bitter almond), that bites you and grabs the attention, but mellows fast. My least favourite part is the middle, a generic floral heart that reminds of the Sephora isle of designer scents in fashion, girly and unspecific. In the final parts, it once again morphs into an almost different perfume, uncovering candied lipsticky facets that slowly fade into a L’instant magic vibe. It is almondy, powdery and flowery. I don’t think I will be adding this to my collection and so far it is my leat favourite of the line. Worth to mention it does not smell like a Chanel (for the better or worse).Edit: the second try is even more unsuccessful, although the three phases seem to be blended better now, probably from maturation. I will say it is in the same vein as Dioramour from Dior and Rose Cherie from Guerlain, both of which I prefer. Do not blind buy Comete thinking that you love Chanel and you cannot go wrong with it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Chanel/Comete-90434.html,Comète Chanel perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Most of the unfavorable reviews say it’s mediocre, underwhelming, insufficiently distinctive, etc. No one is saying they actively dislike it, but I am here to validate you if you find this kinda gross like I do. It opens pleasantly enough, sparkling semi-sweet iris. But for me the drydown smells like stale beer, I could not stand it at all. I was on a long car ride after spraying it at the Chanel beauty boutique, I wore it for at least five hours without scrubbing. It made me sick TBH. Lots of people I respect really appreciate this, so it’s too bad my skin does not work with it. I can't be alone, can I…"

I appreciate it as a great work, but it's not for me. It's neither modern nor retro. Even though I love Chanel, I won't force myself to love this. I tried it, but it's just not my scent."

This tuberose is blended so well to be somewhat of a manly tuberose. I love this one. Great pickup for men that like floral notes. Beach boat sun water for men. Anytime anywhere for women. Great release that is probably overlooked because of the Deified greatness.

Too bright and sharply sweet for me in the opening.After it settles there’s coconut, tuberose, bergamot, a touch of rum barely detectable.Like sitting on a dry hay stack surrounded by a meadow with freshly cut grass, and you spilled pinacolada on yourself…but you’re in Hawaii or somewhere tropical…There :-)"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I purchased a 2ml sample and this is two sprays on the skin late morning about 69 degrees weather review. The initial smell is of melted rubber tires, the davana and hay are very prominent to my nose and I can't help but scrub it off. I fancy tuberose and this one is rolled in hey, then presented with a delicate bundle of tobacco leaves. It leans rather masculine IMO, I do have Rouge Malachite, so yeah, I'll stick that pretty juice instead. The drydown smells like dried-out Play-Doh. I'll give it a few more tests and may update this review if my experience changes. Not a safe blind buy.ps, purchased with Levar del Sole and that one didn't fair any better...will review it soon."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Instant love! I was afraid of the comparison to Rouge malachite since the tuberrose in that one isn’t for me. However, in this one the tuberrose is blended beautifully with the coconut and the other notes. The greenness, which I was afraid would make me feel queasy doesn’t bother me either. On my skin this is a beautiful combination of creamy and spicy. I find it to be an interesting, memorable and unique composition at the same time as it is wearable. It seems to project well since it has already garnered compliments. Only have a sample but this one is definitely going on my wishlist."

The white florals and hay are just going stinky on me and for whatever reason to add a cleaner note on top is just gives an aerosol spray of something I do not want on my skin. Had to wash it off.skin test: 3/10
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Curious about this one. Looks like Jasmine et Cigarette and Rouge Malachite mix by the notes.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Not for me, but extremely well made.This is truly a green tuberose fragrance, specially in the opening.The dry down is the best part of it, where you can feel the warm hay note and it really gets you to a southern Italian summer.Rich, but not heavy. Subtle sweetness, not sugary at all. To my nose it's a feminine fragrance, not unisex, but, of course, a man can totally pull it off."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Blind bought this, mainly because the notes looked promising (tuberose is a top 3 note for me), the bottle is gorgeous, positive reviews, curiosity for the brand and a HUGE discount (100 euros!) on deloox. I would not have blind bought this at full price but i felt like splurging 175 on something i wanted really badly.Im incredibly impressed. this scent is really hard to explain, since its surprisingly very multi faceted. Im gonna try to break it downThe opening: this part threw me off a little at first. it is incredibly green & bitter (and almost industrial) for the first minute. as it settles on ur skin, the rum and the spices show up. while those notes are doing their thing, the tuberose and coconut in the middle start to say hi. this combination creates an unexpected effect, where it has the same bitter/medicinal yet sweet attribute as marzipan. it doesnt smell like marzipan, but it smells like what marzipan tastes like ykwim? That may not sound good, but it works incredibly well with this natural and delicious smelling tuberose and coconut combo. The sweetness in this perfume is far from synthetic smelling. its never cloying or sickening to me. As the marzipan fades away, the tuberose gets especially pronounced while maintaining its bitter green aspects. it remains sweet, but this time it becomes more honey like.middle/drydown: this is where i notice the base notes the most. it becomes quite bitter again, but this time theres no new sweetness. The tuberose is taking the lead and the coconut remains in the background, just like all the other notes. Its not Carnal Flower level of tuberose though, since its not being supported by other white flowers here.Even though tobacco and hay dont necessarily smell clean, the middle part becomes a tad bit soapy in some aspects and in some sniffs. I like this a lot because it feels like im smelling an unlit cigarette and expensive soap at the same time. This soapiness isnt too pronounced, so if you dont like soapiness, you dont have to worry.The perfume eventually retains this state and warms up slightly by the tonka in the most beautiful way. its a tuberose coconut combo that never smells like sunscreen. it doesnt smell tropical either. SOmetimes i do notice the coconut a bit more than other times, but i dont find that to be a bad thing.late drydown: after hours and hours of performing, i sudddenly find my arm smelling like Do Son ! It seems like once every note is gone, the tuberose decides to stay and make it known that she wasnt here to play. the end of Quattro pizzi is like the beginning of Do Son, and i really love that scent. its pleasant and natural smelling.Quattro pizzi is just warm and bitter enough to be enjoyable in cold weather. If you love tuberose, you might need to give this some time. top notes are important cuz they give u a first impression of what a perfume is gonna be like, but here its not the case. it goes from being borderline unbearable to a wonderful perfect green sweet tuberose. It doesnt smell like any other perfume either, until after 8 hours. dont blind buy it but definitely try it out and try to get to know her"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Received a decant after I purchased other perfumes, it sat for some weeks on my shelf and today I decided to give it a try since I adore tuberose. I sprayed both of my wrists and off I went.Our first salutation was rough, I didn’t like the opening, I felt it quite harsh and I thought: “one perfume I will not buy”. After a few hours I came back to the room where I sprayed it and OMG the smell was delicious, I then smelled my wrists and I was just done for the day.To say I BATHED in QP and emptied that poor decant like I was taking a shower in a luscious garden is an understatement. As you can imagine, I just added QP to my “I want it” list. Lovely scent, a bit musky, a warm and inviting dry down… the tuberose is so creamy in all of its loudness. FB worthy!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I find this scent similar to (not a dupe) Frank Boclet Cocaine plus lots and lots of coconut added, less medicinal, more sweet. Iam loving the hay note. QP is little too sweet for my taste however I can imagine how it would be a perfect scent for right person. Slightly more feminine unisex imo. I don't know how I get this but it in some way it reminded me of Pas Ce Soir by BDK. Maybe Pas ce Soir on a tropical vacation."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Not a sage blind buy. The opening is nice but in the middle i can smell patchouli.. i don’t like it.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"After watching some perfume bloggers' YouTube videos and reading numerous reviews, I decided to purchase this fragrance blindly. Cue the ""No! No! No!"" bookshelf scene from Interstellar—that's how I'm now watching myself blindly buying this in the past. While I adore Marfa by Memo (not that they're similar, but I do enjoy tuberose), this one just doesn't work for me at all.From the moment I opened the box, the scent made me feel nauseous, and even thinking about it brings that sensation back. I've given it multiple chances, testing it on both warm and cool days, but I can barely tolerate it for more than 10 minutes on my skin before I feel the desperate need to scrub it off. I can’t pinpoint which component or combination is causing such a strong reaction in me.Interestingly, my husband finds the fragrance ""quite pleasant at first, but with something in it that starts to scratch at your senses and eventually feels a bit suffocating.""As for its longevity and projection, they're undeniably impressive—unfortunately for me. I can still detect it on my skin after a shower and in the room hours after it's been sprayed.While I don't think the composition itself is bad, it just didn’t work for me. I strongly recommend trying it out before committing to a full bottle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"My first from this house and it does not disappoint one bit. Its a beautifully sweet scent that melts into an almost honey with hay scent with tobacco and rum sitting in the background. I think this is a perfect scent for spring-fall. It could work in winter but it might not be heavy enough. I easily get 12 hours of big longevity. Like people can still smell me from a couple arms lengths away easily. I also notice this scent likes you to be warm and when you are it radiates off you like you just ingested some split atoms. I can still smell this scent on me over 24 hours later! Granted at this point (28hrs) its a skin scent, but it is still there. Absolute homerun scent. Please go out and smell this. I think it will be a future classic."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Omg love at first sniff.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"At the first smell, it feels like it is a bit more feminine but in my opinion it is a really sexy unisex fragrance. Tubereuse is usually a feminine smelling flower. However this is a tubereuse fragrance, the rum, tobacco and green notes settles this fragrance as unisex. I think I can't smell the tobacco leaf very much, but the rum note can be easily detected. They added a depth in a more masculine way. Ofc it is definetely not a masculine fragrance but these notes pulls the feminine smell of tubereuse to a unisex side. Furthermore there is a very smooth coconut that creates a creamy sweetness in the background.For me it is a perfect, well-blended and unique signature scent for both genders. Easily wearable for all seasons but not for all occasions. I expect it has an excellent performance for this kind of scent profile.Scent: 9/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Rouge Malachite is my signature scent so of course I had to try this. I sprayed RM on one arm and this on the other arm and observed how they performed during the day. At first, they smell almost identical, but there is a slight green scent with QP. RM is more bubblegummy. The dry down is where they started to separate a bit more around hour 2. RM stayed true to it's composition and I found QP started going more sharp foral, it lost the creaminess. By hour 8 QP was no longer detectible, while RM was holding strong. RM works beautifully for me and my skin chemistry. If I had never found RM, I would absolutely buy QP."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,This smells absolutely nothing like Rouge Malachite. The tuberose isn’t bubble gummy. This fragrance is very green. The coconut smells clean and semi milky. The other notes are blended so well I can’t really pinpoint any of them. This is a well blended fragrance but unfortunately not my cup of tea.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Love this stuff !
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"As a creamy tuberose scent, this has some uniqueness, it is aromatic and hay note is well felt. Together with coconut they form an unexpected combination. It's green, aromatic, sweet and tropical creamy. I can't say I like it though. In comparison, Tubereuse Nue is creamier and cleaner tuberose, Rouge Malachite is warmer because of amber and there is also yellow floral sweetness felt. Quatro Pizzi is a mature tuberose, not a fair, fragile ballerina."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I’m starting to really narrow down my favorite tuberose scents and Quattro Pizzi is probably my #1! This is so beautiful, regal, heavenly, and exotic. What seals the deal is the coconut; it’s a very creamy version, not dry, watery, or flaky at all. I feel like a goddess wearing this. The note composition makes it unique enough to stand out amongst other tuberose fragrances. Bravo, Xerjoff!!"

Tuberose, tobacco and coconut are in my top 10 notes and they blend so beautifully here. The tuberose is slightly sweet, lifting the heavier notes. The coconut is not sunscreen-y at all and sort of fills out the fragrance. The tobacco really shines in the dry down and lends a woodiness to the composition. I feel this could be worn in any weather and can't wait to see how it performs in the winter. I feel this is completely unisex."

Long lasting sure, but very soft. I have to overspray it. Love the scent though, always wanted a more powerful version.Well Quattro is it. One spray is enough.Creamy coconut + tuberose combo. Smells very beachy, a bit like sunscreen. I’ve been asked a few times if I was heading to the beach while wearing this.I don’t get any of the tobacco, hay, or rum.It’s a love for me 🌴🥥"

I owned Naxos which I hated and gave away and also Oesel which was laundry sheets but this... this is amazing. I normally steer clear of Xerjoff but the person at Etiket told me I have to try this and they were right. It invokes images of a place I've never been and to me, perfectly unisex. On me it's mostly turberose and coconut which surprised the sales person as on them it's totally different. Just waiting for this to come back in stock and I'm all over it, highly recommend.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I smelt this in Harrods and loved it instantly. I had a few sprays on my arms, and they wafted deliciously throughout my day. I then purchased a sample to confirm it was worthy of being a full bottle, and now have a 30ml. As a lover of both tuberose and coconut, I knew there was major potential, but I usually don't enjoy tobacco dominant scents, so feared that note could be make or break for me. I've worn QP twice this week, and it projects so beautifully, I get the green tuberose-creamy coconut combination without much of the other notes being apparent. On my first wearing I thought it was perhaps slightly soapy, and although I do still get that, it pulls more like a creamy, clean and green vibe, kind of like I got in Amouage Honour woman - the colours green and white are for sure what I imagine from this scent, and it reminds me of a body lotion type scent. This is also a little bit laundry musk fresh on me, and although I generally find those scents a little one dimensional, this has that aspect whilst also adding the floral and creamy aspects. The longevity and performance are great, easy 6-8 hours and I get gorgeous bursts of scent as I go through my day. I suspect I will upgrade to a 100ml at some point!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I’m not getting what everyone else seems to smell here. Quattro Pizzi has a burst of rum and pepper in the opening which then deepens significantly overtime to tobacco and hay. Tuberose and coconut are waaay in the background, and this barely smells tropical or lactonic. Instead the tuberose imparts a soapy edge that feels very vintage. I am reminded of Bal a Versailles. But the tobacco leaf and hay are a bit overwhelming, and the tobacco smells kind of wet which can give off a wet cardboard /cigar tip / which sometimes imparts a urine quality to me. It smells nothing like Rouge malachite or Soleil Blanc which I am seeing in the smells like section. Maybe something is wrong with my sense of smell right now as this doesn’t even seem to be remotely in the same category. It reminds me more of Naxos, but slightly more feminine. As with most Xerjoff this is long lasting and projects significantly. Overall this is a good scent, but the notes are deceptive and I think there are better tobacco forward scents.Edit - i just smelled Blanche Bete for the first time and this is a huge rip off. It is almost identical but blanche bete is more well done."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is beautiful and reminds me a lot of Byron The Chronic in the dry down. It’s different in the beginning because it’s greener, and you can detect some small amount of that green throughout, but it’s mostly sweet. 8+ hours on me and strong projection. Tuberose lovers will absolutely love this."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I much preferred the dabber over the spray sample because the opening was very harsh for me from the spray, but not at all from the dabber. I agree with a reviewer below that stated it reminds one of Blanche Bete in that it shares that creamy lactonic quality. I'm not sure I need both, but will try side by side this week to test further. Overall, it is a nice creamy tuberose fragrance that I feel is far less green than the accords note it is."

This was a blind buy and a very successful one at that. On my skin QP quickly settles into a soft, but ever-present tuberose and an intoxicating coconut infused delight! THANKFULLY, I don't get the davana or the hay notes, but I would be remiss if I didn't share that Quatrro Pizzi reminds me of a frothy, CREAMY tropical tuberose smoothie that leaves an alluring sillage and projects like a beast!I'm loving this!!!!ETA: Layer Quattro Pizzi with TF Soleil Blanc Shimmering Body Oil...That combo is 🔥🔥🔥"

This comes on very strong to start with. It's beautiful. I was nervous about this because of the coconut, the coconut is not dominate to my nose. A touch of green. After it calmed down on my skin I loved it. I think I'll pick up the 30 ml which would be enough for me as a little really goes a long way."

It does smell clean, royal, regal. . But the vibes remind me of my times spent at gramas (and no not the times of me blowing up her bathroom). I do love it and would not mind smelling this on others, myself, in the air, etc.I'm not a heavy tuberose lover at all but I can get with this. Year round acceptable as well. Long lasting/ huge sillage. Oily texture. Happy to experience this."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Beautiful! Reminds me of Blanche Bete in the way BB fills the room. It’s a similar scent bubble, strong and warm, but QP is more tropical, coconutty. I wouldn’t call it lactonic, but creamy like a summer cocktail. It’s delicious! Lucious tuberose is masked by some green notes at the beginning, then the rum and coconut blossom and it’s so freaking mouthwatering!! Longevity is 8+hours and projection is strong."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I smell the tuberose, and davana/hay that gives it a nice greenness. I would not have guessed that this fragrance had any coconut or vanilla. The tuberose is not as feminine as it is in Armani Rouge Malachite. However if you like one, you will like the other. I usually don't like rum or tobacco heavy fragrances, and I cannot detect those notes in this. I don't smell the honey like I do in Guerlain's Tobacco Honey."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I wanted to love this so much. The notes sounded so perfect, from the davana to the hay passing by the rum and tuberose. I was close to blind buying, but then I smelled it, and I was disappointed as I had imagined it much smoother, especially since it gets compared to Rouge Malachite.The opening is harsh, with an intense green camphorous smell contrasted by a screechy honey-like note. It gets smoother, but not as much as I'd wish and expect (e.g., based on the rum, tonka, and coconut). There is also a sour note in the dry down keeping it from going creamy, probably the tobacco leaves (actually smells realistic, like old cheap unprocessed tobacc leaves that got slightly wet).All in all, I fee it misses a good blend. I wish the opening would smell like it does 2 hours in and then that it would go smoother from there. Maybe if the bottles macerate it gets better?"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is a sexy spicy tuberose with hints of boozy accords! Great date night scent, sexy on a guy or a woman, leans more feminin I would say, but I can see a guy pulling this off if he wants something a bit more floral, spicy and dark.If you love tuberose with a twist, not the bubblegummy, sickly sweet one, this is for you! I get no coconut, but my skin picks up the tobacco leaf and the tonka beans in the drydown. Quality is there and performance as well!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Quatro Pizzi will be my next Xerjoff purchase as soon as can be found on discount sites. It’s very expensive and it smells like that.I get mostly a mix of thick, very spicy tuberose, dark, rich rum and a very green, aromatic davana with hints of coconut, pink pepper, coriander, tobacco leaf and tonka beans. It’s gorgeous and unlike any other Xerjoff I have tried. It’s beautiful done and if you love tuberose, like me, but not the typical, sweet, bubblegumy, girly tuberose, Quatro Pizzi is a must have in my opinion! The deep dry down is mainly a creamy tuberose.Plus, that pearlescent bottle is a true eye candy. Pearlescent bottles speak to my soul for some reason, it makes me want to collect them all. Luckily, the scent smells divine and performs beautifully. It’s really intense and projects strong for the first two hours.Just waiting for a good deal to add Quatro Pizzi to my always growing Xerjoff collection. Instant love!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Beautiful scent, tuberose with coconut is amazing."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Many here have done a great job describing this fragrance. I truly don’t have much to add except, this has just the right amount of tuberose. I wasn’t sure about the blending of these notes but it works. All phases are lovely but, the dry down is my favorite part. This is an easy wear for me."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Wasn’t super sure about purchasing because I thought the rum and tobacco would make this too masculine. Uh, no. This is beautiful and I just love how it projects. Glad I took a leap, this is definitely signature scent worthy imo."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Rouge malachite dupe with more greeness and less complexity.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I have a complicated relationship with tuberose. I like her generally, but geez, sometimes she's too much and then I purge all my indolic frags and roll my eyes when another new scent features tuberose.However, my undying love for coconut had me purchasing a 5ml decant of this, and now on the 3rd wear in Texas June heat, I think this one is really growing on me.The green quality saves Quattro Pizzi--tuberose pairs so well with coconut it's hard to tell where the coconut ends and the floral notes begin. I love rum booziness in perfumes, and it's consistent here even in dry down. I get a Guerlain SDV vibe, if she were on vacation and left the vanilla at home, lol.The greener background notes add balance, the tobacco leaf base is a genius follow up as it tamps down the creamy element making this a good summer pick. This is never cloying or too much--it stays round, boozy, balanced, and fairly dry. In full dry down I'm getting some spice notes and I still enjoy it.This isn't what I expected from Xerjoff; I didn't expect to like this one so much. It might also be worth mentioning that one of my favorite creamy summer scents is Tiziana Terenzi's Vele--another creamy vacation floral balanced by green notes and dry spices/elements."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is what I've been waiting for so long; a perfectly androgynous Tuberose! The sweet creamy side of Tuberose is complimated with Coconut powder. There's underlying warmth from Spiced Rum vibes together with hazy, moist tobacco leaf giving the scent the balance the heady sweetness needs.Imagine a nice little scene: you're holding a delicious Pina Colada, laying down next to the pool. Living your best life while Art Deco music is playing in the background. This exudes careless joy and casual celebration of life."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"This is a nice, very green white floral. I don’t get much rum but I do get a creamy coconut mixed with white florals and strong green notes to keep it fresh and somewhat unique. I’ve read people get all tuberose but I’m happy to say I don’t get overpowering tuberose (not my fave) and I think it’s the Devana and another white floral I can’t quite figure out that keeps it from going too far in that direction. In the dry down i get less green, more of a smooth tonka bean with a mild creamy coconut and faint white florals - this is my favourite stage. Perfect for late spring/summer and performance is good. Not sure how it happened but it’s already at discounters so definitely worth that price. Don’t think it’s worth retail (though I rarely think many perfumes are). It reminds me a bit of debaser by ds & Durga … though not as indolic and striking (ie this is easier to wear). Not dupes by any stretch but same vein."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I really enjoy this new release. In the opening, it has the green aspect, but on my skin it dissipates without a trace rather quickly leaving behind a creamy mix of coconut, tuberose, and tonka beans. While the scent is really creamy, it never gets too heavy or cloying. To me this is very feminine, and appropriate for really any occasion. Can easily be someone’s signature scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I need to mention first that I don't know which kind of period is going on because I don't like to wear Tuberoses. It used to be one of my favourites. I feel that flower now somewhat suffocating and I'm enjoying a lot nowadays scents where is Jasmine without Tuberose. Nevertheless I seem to enjoy Quattro Pizzi but this strange phase of mine seems understandable to affect on my opinion.Quattro Pizzi opens up with a straightforward Tuberose and the sharp and bitter ""kick into the face"" like Davana which luckily fades away quickly. Even if I try I don't detect other opening notes which is because I feel Tuberose is dominating all the time. Coconut joins into them making the overall texture creamy and tropical. Tuberose and Coconut combination feels heavy in this heat and cloying from time to time which makes me think would it be better in colder weather but on the other hand it's very smooth and cozy and I love the scent trail which it leaves after my husband. For sure this is better around you than sniffed on your skin. My favourite part of this scent is the dry down when the scent becomes infinitely soft, a much more transparent with fresh greenish nuances while Tonka Beans are still keeping it mellow.If you love Tuberose and Coconut I think this is definitely for you. This is a strong scent and it lasts easily all the day. The number of sprays has a radical effect on the attractiveness of the fragrance. Here less is more and I'm an oversprayer.Top: Rum, Davana, Pink Pepper , CorianderMiddle: Tuberose , CoconutBase: Hay, Blonde Leaf Tobacco , Tonka BeanThank you for reading and if you want to follow me on IG: @ninamariah_perfumes"

It opens up very fresh and green, and settles into the most gorgeous, creamy tropical scent. I’m not always a fan of coconut, but this is so well balanced from the tuberose with hint of tobacco. It’s almost “soapy,” but in the best way possible. It’s like a luxurious, creamy lotion that you’d find at an expensive island resort. It’s a very clean, unique, and feminine, perfect for summer days."

My girlfriend smelled it on me and she loved it so much that she insisted that I buy a bottle on the spot, which she never did with other fragrances.Smells perfect for spring and summer, like a fresh garden of flowers with some coconut in the background and rum. The performance is great on me and feels unisex enough to be worn by both men and women. I can see the Naxos comparison, but feels like a lighter version for a hot day.Lately I got tired of citrus heavy fragrances so this one might become my hot weather signature smell, being different enough from what the majority is wearing.Projection is strong in the first hour after it feels like an amazing lingering smell.Not recommended for blind buy."

It stays close to the skin with okay longevity. The hay and a soft tuberose are most prominent to me and I like it a lot. I'll be honest I don't know what davana smells like but it must add something to make the perfume not smell like food yet spicy or herby?It's like taking a deep breath on a hot day in the shade of a willow tree there is a garden somewhere with flowers and hay bales in the distance.9/10"

It's a stylish summer fragrance, pretty long-lasting on me (7-8 hours), and the price of a 30 ml bottle is also quite convenient. I would buy a 30 ml, but not a bigger bottle. Why? Because I will use it strictly during summer. It simply does not work otherwise."

Rum, coconut, tobacco, tonka, tuberose, davana?? Add to cart immediately. Sign me up! I am a Xerjoff & Casamorati fan, so this was a no-brainer. I got it. I smelled it. I've worn it. I hate it. I'm gutted to say this, but this fragrance is vile. It smells like some kind of horrible potpourri or the cheap pink soap they have in any busy public restroom except it is 10x stronger. One plus (well, a minus in my case) is that the sillage is absolutely monstrous and it lasts for decades."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,I’m thoroughly enjoying a decant of this. On my skin It’s like if Rouge Malachite and Blanche bête had a baby but the tuberose is toned down and much more subtle and not lactonic. With a splash of non synthetic creamy coconut in the dry down… after a few hours the coconut slowly fades to the background and then the hay and greenish tobacco comes through… but ever so light (like un Air d’Apogee).

I already have 100ml bottle of RM which I will never use up in my lifetime! Now I have 200ml of pretty much the same fragrance. Both bottles are stunning though...What can I say, I love Xerjoff but their releases lately have been so dissapointing. Who knows maybe they're soon to be selling their souls to Loreal as well."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I really like this. I’ve worn it 5 times now and it’s gotten better with wear. I’ll admit the first wear I was a little off put by the opening but it faded quite fast into the mid notes and now whatever is in the opening that originally bothered me doesn’t anymore. The majority of the fragrance is a coconut creamy tuberose which I adore. If you don’t like tuberose then you won’t like this fragrance. I definitely get the coconut, it’s mixed with the tuberose to give it a creamy feel but tuberose is the star here. It wears beautifully on my skin. Projects very well for a quite some time and has amazing longevity, it stayed on my skin all day and still got wafts of it during the night when I would wake up.I agree with the reviewer below saying that this will probably be hyped and sought after, I definitely think that as I’ve gotten positive feedback on it since I got it. After the opening subsides, it seems like a crowd pleasing fragrance to me, however I do think some might be off put by the first spray but give it a little time to transform before judging if it’s for you or not.Referring to the reminds me of section: I think it shares similarities with Blanche Bete which I also own and love but is definitely not the same just has some similar aspects and it doesn’t smell like Naxos at all to me. I own that one as well but on my skin they couldn’t be further from each other. Naxos also leans masculine to my nose even though I still wear it. To me Quattro Pizzi is unisex enough but leaning heavily feminine and I think women will gravitate to this more than men. I’d say it’s a safe blind buy for a tuberose lover BUT I would still suggest sampling first since it may not be what you are expecting and from the sounds of it, it seems to pull a lot different on some peoples skin but thankfully for me it’s a beautiful sweet, creamy, coconut laced tuberose heavy fragrance that will get a lot of use for me this spring/summer.Edit:Wearing it more and now on the dry down I get the tobacco coming through. It’s very subtle though."

To my nose, it's similar to Blanche Bete mixed with Heartless Helen and a splash of Pina Colada - a sweet, creamy and tart summer composition, one I think will be very hyped and sought after this year. I find it pleasant but ultimately underwhelming - I like my beach fragrances salty and my tuberose more grape than bubblegum."

This was a blind buy and a very successful one at that. On my skin QP quickly settles into a soft, but ever-present tuberose and an intoxicating coconut infused delight! THANKFULLY, I don't get the davana or the hay notes, but I would be remiss if I didn't share that Quatrro Pizzi reminds me of a frothy, CREAMY tropical tuberose smoothie that leaves an alluring sillage and projects like a beast!I'm loving this!!!!ETA: Layer Quattro Pizzi with TF Soleil Blanc Shimmering Body Oil...That combo is 🔥🔥🔥"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"It’s not tuberose forward as the site suggests. After an hour it smells like a way more unisex, maybe a touch feminine leaning Naxos. Not enough tuberose, not enough coconut for me. Mostly a white creamy smell with fresh, somewhat sharp at the beginning white florals."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I have a complicated relationship with tuberose. I like her generally, but geez, sometimes she's too much and then I purge all my indolic frags and roll my eyes when another new scent features tuberose.However, my undying love for coconut had me purchasing a 5ml decant of this, and now on the 3rd wear in Texas June heat, I think this one is really growing on me.The green quality saves Quattro Pizzi--tuberose pairs so well with coconut it's hard to tell where the coconut ends and the floral notes begin. I love rum booziness in perfumes, and it's consistent here even in dry down. I get a Guerlain SDV vibe, if she were on vacation and left the vanilla at home, lol.The greener background notes add balance, the tobacco leaf base is a genius follow up as it tamps down the creamy element making this a good summer pick. This is never cloying or too much--it stays round, boozy, balanced, and fairly dry. In full dry down I'm getting some spice notes and I still enjoy it.This isn't what I expected from Xerjoff; I didn't expect to like this one so much. It might also be worth mentioning that one of my favorite creamy summer scents is Tiziana Terenzi's Vele--another creamy vacation floral balanced by green notes and dry spices/elements."

It opens up very fresh and green, and settles into the most gorgeous, creamy tropical scent. I’m not always a fan of coconut, but this is so well balanced from the tuberose with hint of tobacco. It’s almost “soapy,” but in the best way possible. It’s like a luxurious, creamy lotion that you’d find at an expensive island resort. It’s a very clean, unique, and feminine, perfect for summer days."

Rum, coconut, tobacco, tonka, tuberose, davana?? Add to cart immediately. Sign me up! I am a Xerjoff & Casamorati fan, so this was a no-brainer. I got it. I smelled it. I've worn it. I hate it. I'm gutted to say this, but this fragrance is vile. It smells like some kind of horrible potpourri or the cheap pink soap they have in any busy public restroom except it is 10x stronger. One plus (well, a minus in my case) is that the sillage is absolutely monstrous and it lasts for decades."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Xerjoff/Quattro-Pizzi-91640.html,Quattro Pizzi Xerjoff perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"After watching some perfume bloggers' YouTube videos and reading numerous reviews, I decided to purchase this fragrance blindly. Cue the ""No! No! No!"" bookshelf scene from Interstellar—that's how I'm now watching myself blindly buying this in the past. While I adore Marfa by Memo (not that they're similar, but I do enjoy tuberose), this one just doesn't work for me at all.From the moment I opened the box, the scent made me feel nauseous, and even thinking about it brings that sensation back. I've given it multiple chances, testing it on both warm and cool days, but I can barely tolerate it for more than 10 minutes on my skin before I feel the desperate need to scrub it off. I can’t pinpoint which component or combination is causing such a strong reaction in me.Interestingly, my husband finds the fragrance ""quite pleasant at first, but with something in it that starts to scratch at your senses and eventually feels a bit suffocating.""As for its longevity and projection, they're undeniably impressive—unfortunately for me. I can still detect it on my skin after a shower and in the room hours after it's been sprayed.While I don't think the composition itself is bad, it just didn’t work for me. I strongly recommend trying it out before committing to a full bottle."

The white florals and hay are just going stinky on me and for whatever reason to add a cleaner note on top is just gives an aerosol spray of something I do not want on my skin.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Crivelli/Tubereuse-Astrale-90733.html,Tubéreuse Astrale Maison Crivelli perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"A Flemish legend has it that the Gruwenhald, a half-human, half-elven creature, roams the countryside during the first full moon night after the summer solstice to gather the right flowers and herbs to create his magical narcotizing potion, capable of enrapturing anyone, so that he can kidnap them and lead them to his abode, where they will remain forever as slaves. The recipe for the magical perfume apparently includes unconventional ingredients, such as fairy wings and unicorn blood. Well, after selling his soul to Beelzebub to obtain the details of that recipe, it appears that the chief alchemist of House Crivelli was then forced to spread evil on Earth through a series of other nefarious and heinous creations, such as Oud Stallion and Iris Malikhan.Some scholars at the University of Massachusetts have recently measured the KENergetic levels of Tubereuse Astrale, finding values that are completely off the scale and unprecedented; its plastic whiff may in fact be an indication of the presence of parts of poor KEN itself, but this has not yet been confirmed; an autopsy is awaited.An empirical test of mine on cardboard showed this to be the absolute and by far the best performing and longest lasting extract from Maison Crivelli. Test that anyone can replicate, try it to believe. The scent itself is complex, floral, assertive almost to the point of being stunning, where the tuberose is made sublime, accompanied by a symphony of notes that makes it incomparable. Off-scale projection, infinite duration. Unfortunately, it caused me a very uncomfortable skin reaction, especially on my neck so, despite trying several times, I have not yet been able to wear it for more than a few minutes, I will try again in milder temperatures or in the next life, when I have a bulletproof body.Try it on and hope you don't like it, or the Gruwenhald will capture you."

Everything that it touches will likely smell like that for hours. Personally it's a bit too much for daily wear but I can see the appeal. I think this might annoys me a little bit sometimes, and I do like tuberose in general. It's a like so far, but won't buy."

It is a beautiful floral and also a dark, dirty rich anamalic almost oudish quality as well. Though I think it leans fem it could definitely be worn by a man. Strong start and great lingerer as it moves through its dry down.She is a lady in the living room and a seductress in the master.

I rarely pay full price for fragrances, but this and hibiscus mahajad are worth it. This fragrance made me fall in love with cinnamon, who knew, because in most fragrances the cinnamon drowns in sea of other mouth watering notes. The first time you spray it, try your best to wait to form an opinion, then try it again and you will fall in love. It’s unique, it’s rich, it’s intoxicating, and the longevity is great. For me the longevity is better with this than HM, but I may also go nose blind to that one pretty quickly but everyone else can smell it, leaving a a very sophisticated scent trail. Although the base notes in this one are vanilla and musk, I can smell the top and mid notes all day! I love that for me because at this price point the last thing I want Is to smell like vanilla at the end of the day.This does NOT to be layered by any means, it is most beautiful on its on. BUT because of my cinnamon obsession at the moment, I decided to give it a try with Initio’s Side Effect to make it slight more feminine on my skin for a special occasion. Side Effect and a touch of Tubereuse is really nice. I am looking for a back up bottle, I need it forever."

Also a hugeee compliment getter, and when I tell you I've been getting compliments this summer from literally everyone, even people who usually can smell me but never say anything. Probably means something ey? A gorgeous mix of floral, spicy, leathery and even woody at times.My dad smelled it on me once and was like ""Wow what a beautiful fragrance, is that pine""? It's a type of spiciness that hints of freshness with just the right amount of Tuberose sweetness. Quentin does it again for sure! And I don't get people who can't tell the astrality of this, cz I sure feel heavenly every time it touches my nose! Desperately in need of a second bottle."

Then something happened in the dry down and I fell in love and ended up buying a full bottle. It has such a creamy almost coconuty with a hint of cinnamon vibe that lasts all day! I got two compliments in one day, which is rare for me. I’ve never noticed tuberose before in any fragrance because I’m not a big floral fragrance lover, but I don’t find it to be a floral scent at all. On the days where I want to feel myself and smell myself, I put on two spritzes which is more than enough. Beast mode you can choke someone out easily with this."

I would certainly lose clients if I did.I'm all for bold scents, but there's bold-stunning-classy and there's bold-needy-compensating, and this is in the latter category.Update: the mid stage up close is really beautiful, sort of nutty and leathery, whereas from a distance it's the chemical tuberose still.... But....Next day, it's still projecting strongly from my skin. It's just way too strong.I don't like perfumes that stop me wearing something else the next day and after washing, and which are indelible on clothes."

More than what I can keep track of. I attempt to try them all, especially now that I'm taking this seriously as a profession. And I like to think I have good taste. Well folks, be prepared to fork out $300 because even in this economy, this baby is worth it. Let's talk about sex baby. This is what they were talking about when they said tuberose is narcotic. Seductive. In intoxicating Fashion. There is also some magic going on in the background. The Quentin Magic. He is most certainly the guy right now. Most of his other work has this similar Quality to it, something I'm unable to explain. Unable to articulate. It's sex. In its most hedonistic form. Quentin makes fragrances that turn you on. They make you moan out loud and then subsequently spray all over your body. Like every other fragrance, there is a time and a place. You don't want to be wearing this in the middle of an existential crisis, or when you're angry at a family member, or when you're depressed, nostalgic or melancholic. There are of course other ones for that. You can never tell me there is one fragrance for every day. Because there isn't. There are some days, and I will admit are fewer now than before, where I want to be desired and feel desired from all different directions. And I want that desire fulfilled in every single way possible and in the worst way possible. This is the fragrance for those days. The days you are unsatiated and love every minute of it."

The fragrance is changeable, sometimes it's warm spices, which play in front and tuberose is somewhere on the backstage and sometimes the beautiful delicate tuberose is more prominent. Overall very round , pleasant, quite warm and cozy fragrance but it has its character, complexity and uniqueness. One absolutely can not compare it to other tuberose fragrances, this one is far more higher level and sophisticated.Not for amateurs but for true connoisseurs."

It also has a wild strawberry scent in the sillage. Very thick, sweet, sparkling fragrance. The tuberose here is so honeyed, at its peak bloom, not heavy at all. One of the best tuberoses I've ever tried, it's like it's really from another dimension - the name is very accurate. I really like it. It smells like spring flowers' blossom, strawberries, and warmth. Very thick fragrance. The closest thing I've tried before is Linterdit and Addictive Vibration by Initio. The same vibe of honeyed flowers and spring. Nothing special, but nice. The longevity is insane: I got a headache, one spray will be enough.

It settles down into a creamy vanilla musk. The cinnamon is very slight and I barely smell it. I typically love tuberose scents but the tuberose doesn’t quite come through in the first fifteen minutes. It does waft in and out so it is an interesting experience. Lasts for 2 hours with a scent bubble before it becomes a skin scent. Spouse said it smells good like a candle.Purchased sample from ZGO Perfumery, influenced from YouTuber Anne Lauren.

Well, ten stars for tenaciousness because this thing was still on my skin after scrubbing and a shower!Tuberose is my second favorite note, and since everyone in my groups is talking favorably about this, I thought I'd love it, but this is two strikes against Crivelli for me, so I'm out."

I had a free sample, had never tried any M Crivelli but am blown away by this. The opening is strong, a bit challenging but the most amazing mix of tuberose and osmanthus emerges with slivers of cinnamon, hints of cumin and a soft smokey leather with an apricot biscuit base. I’m so impressed! It was created by Quentin Bisch who’s a very clever perfumer……I love it! Also this is an extrait so I feel you get good value for money. It’s expensive but it’s worth every drop!!Edit. Bought a 50ml bottle and it gets loads of comments. Very long lasting!"

Starting with the positive, the leather accord is really nice - it’s relatively light, clean and seems similar to the one used in Neroli Nasimba where I like it even more. Performance is very strong as well and it’s versatile enough to wear most of the time.It’s interesting that the brand mentions a sparkling tuberose accord because sparkle is what I found lacking. There’s just a dull muddled quality to the blending on my skin, the notes seem to restrain one another rather than accentuate, the tuberose struggles to show itself through the cinnamon, which is held down by the leather accord. As it wears on the musk and animalics ramp up but I couldn’t shake the impression of some kind of nuttiness, something akin to peanut oil, unwashed children’s hair, already chewed gum. A general feeling of staleness. Yes, it went downhill quite quickly there at the end. I’ll put it down to a bad mix with my skin.Quintin Bisch’s signature is all over this, for better or worse, so fans may love it but doubters are unlikely to be converted."

Love at first sniff! This is strong, so 2-3 light sprays max. I struggle with tuberose. Many Tuberose fragrances are a fail for me. Rolling in love was way too quiet. Cafe tuberosa was weird, and I just didn’t vibe with Good girl gone bad. This has lots of cinnamon, and I love it. There is definitely a tuberose presence. It’s creamy, somewhat sweet, very unique. Hard to describe! I know reviews are polarizing because of the leather note. I’m realizing that I love leather and suede notes. They don’t turn fragrances masculine in my opinion, whereas I usually dislike a tobacco note. Try before you buy, but as for myself, I’m head over heels in love!"

No tuberose but the kickiest cinnamon I’ve ever smelled in a perfume absolutely leaps off the skin, and then melts into a warm dense musky kind of base with a hint of vanilla. If there is tuberose it’s more the idea of it than the actual flower which is usually so dominant in a fragrance where it’s used. Maybe it’s there but just barely and if so it’s the lush dense kind of tuberose and it just offers the tiniest tinge of florality to this spicy musk base which is actually the entirety of the scent, as Tubéreuse Astrale is quite linear. I got interested in this because I’m on a tuberose kick and I saw all the hype but didn’t read any reviews first so this kind of shocked me. I’m still trying to wrap my head around a tuberose fragrance with barely any tuberose. I objectively like this scent apart from the disappointment of the tuberose (because it does smell good) but it doesn’t last long, so there’s that."

Worn on skin for a whole day, also sprayed on a blotter:This is an extrait and true to the definition of it: Very strong. Only one spray on skin and it projects for the whole day (6-8 hours) and is still detectable as a skin scent after shower.Leans more masculine than feminine.The name and the note pyramid on Fragrantica are misleading - this is not a floral, or even a tuberereuse dominant scent. Actually I think the note pyramid is very misleading. I suggest checking the Maison Crivelli website to get a proper notes' breakdown.On the Maison Crivelli website the scent is described as a ""floral leather perfume"" - note the leather! - and in my opinion this is an apt description of what this is: a leather perfume (osmanthus dried down to its least floral?) with light touch of spice (this is not your Dolce Vita cinnamon and neverheard of any gourmands) and even lighter (imaginary?) tubereuse. I would assume the cistus/labdnum (ambergris) is the softener ment to round up the scent but the musks are rather heavy in the drydown. Maison Crivelli lists cistus on their website, Fragrantica does not...To me this smells like a pretty classic men's aftershave, one that I would not be particularly fond of. I suppose there's some novelty in the added tubereuse but for me it drowns within much more dominant leather and musks. Even the ""forgotten"" (by Fragrantica) labdanum is more present.I suppose ""something different"" if you wear it as a woman, not so much to talk about for a man."

I'm very surprised that nobody has mentioned this. The dry down is where the differences come in and both stand on their own... Tubéreuse Astrale with the leathery aspects and Blanche Bête with the cacao milk. They could be fraternal twins if you ask me.There is nothing light about Tubéreuse Astrale.

This just smells expensive, up there with $500 niche perfumes.I’ve yet to come across a scent quite like Tuberose Astrale. Im shocked this isn’t rated higher as it’s much more edgy and unisex than Hibiscus Mahajád. 100% full bottle worthy due to the uniqueness, and beautiful smooth dry down."

I can smell a really strong wood a bit like cedar in this which definitely makes it more male leaning. In this I do not detect any tuberose at all but get some type of space like pink pepper, and a detection of cinnamon. It is strong and will last on your skin even after washing it. Its definitely hard to describe but it's not something I would wear myself. Would be amazing on a male. I say it is more evening and autumn to early spring myself.

It's not carnal, lush, or green. It is a bubblegum tuberose through and through. The cinnamon doesn't verge on big red gum territory, but it is blended well enough in the right quantity to add to the gummy sweetness. Maybe more like juicy fruit. There is a clean leather smoothness here, texture wise, that delivers this without harshness even with its good performance. Reminds me of Robert Piguet Fracas Petit; the original I haven't smelt but heard it's less sweet than Petit. This is a little less sweet and more smooth. A very likable niche fragrance. Projection is moderate-strong and then becomes low moderate after 5-6 hours. This lasts 8 hours+.I just read fragrantica's description 3 days after my thoughts and yes, it's spot on. I thought the leather vibe was coming from the osmanthus but the perfumer actually and intentionally added leather accords with the tuberose. Or maybe they heightened the leather accord in the floral note because I did not get a peachy vibe in this fragrance."

The latter is not off putting in any way- it’s actually a lovely attention grabber (in the most unexpected way). I kept sniffing my arm and shirt when it would waft to me throughout the 8 hours or so I could smell it.

Sort of Tuberose that Givenchy utilize in most of their L'interdit line. But, weird. I also perceive the authentic side of tuberose at the same time, Might be Osmanthus that helping. And yeah, tuberose in this is not carnal at all to my nose.As scent develop, it is slightly leathery as time pass.But Tuberose is thickening, sweeter, it is sweet experience.But it is never be bubblegummy tuberose like most designer.When the scent reach final dry-down the tuberose in natural interpretation shown.Softly green, Floral Sweet with Soft Vanilla (hybrid creamy / powdery) hue.I think this one is beautifully arranged which evidence in Haibicus MahajadCharm in Tubéreuse Astrale is cohesive story telling from top to bottom.It is Floral / Soft amber to my nose and while it is uncomplicated.The development of scent is beautifully done, the complication of blending is from perfuemer.However for end user, this retains ease of use and functionality with niche quality.I personally think, I will definitely add Tuberose astaral due to unique tone down hard use of Tuberose Into sweeter format but retains quality of Tuberose. I do agree with Fountain30's review. This might be actually best Maison Crivelli to date because this is very smooth experience.I was digging in realm of higher quality designer White-Florental before (you name it, I own most of them) Jasmine Rogue, Rogue Malachite, Supreme Bouquet, Balcaimi.. Tubéreuse Astrale uniqueness is being combo fruity bubble-gummy, thick but lust, real Tuberose.

This is a larger than life but extremely smooth unisex white floral. I found the longevity to be insane and the projection was very good too. The opening took my breath away. As it settled, the tuberose note became louder and louder before eventually settling on a musky vanilla base. Absolutely outstanding perfume, would work well for all seasons and 2 sprays MAX is all you need to get yourself noticed. The only thing I will add, and I do think this should be considered is that this is not a ""bubblegum"" tuberose. It is very photorealistic and IMO leans on the mature side. Absolutely to be enjoyed by all genders though but I'd recommend this specifically to the 30+ crowd. Amazing stuff!"

As it unfolds on the skin, layers of creamy tuberose intertwine with hints of spicy cardamom and velvety suede, creating a mesmerizing olfactory tapestry that captivates the soul.

I saw so many rave reviews for this one and thought maybe the tuberose would smell better in this (I can tolerate a bubblegummy tuberose but it's really not my cup of tea), and many reviews seem to suggest so but the tuberose in here is absolutely violently heady to me. There is nothing sweet or bubblegummy about this tuberose it is very photorealistically floral in my opinion and it is insanely strong (as most other Maison Crivelli and Quentin Bisch creations). I kept the blotter card on my kitchen counter and every time I entered my apartment I was hit with a strong unpleasant smell and followed my nose to find out that this smell was in fact coming from this blotter card and not my kitchen garbage can. This scent is hard to describe as while it is predominately tuberose, it doesn't feel very floral as the base notes make this scent rather thick and heavy. This fragrance is very well blended such that I really can't pick up any other notes, and to me the other notes have a sole purpose of adding depth and dimension to this tuberose.As with Guidance, I really don't get this one. It seems like my opinion is in the minority for this one but if I were to wear this on my skin I'm almost confident it would make me sick."

In the opening I get hardly any tuberose at all, but rather a combination of cinnamon and a kind of harsh synthetic leathery note. Over time (30 minutes to an hour) this opening calms down a bit and I think I can detect a slight hint of underlying tuberose but it is still a mostly spice and chemical leather smell. In the interests of full disclosure, I have only tested this once and maybe I will change my mind, if I try it again, but I am posting this mostly as a caution against blind buying because, if your nose is at all like mine, you will be very surprised and probably disappointed by what you get.

Off the bat this is exceptionally floral and strong, I do not know what Tuberose smells like in real life in the wild, so can only comment on what I *do* know. This (to me) is as photorealistic as it can be with regards to the flower, it also smells like how I know Jasmine (Egyptian and those that can be grown in the UK in gardens) and Honeysuckle smells as they perpetuate on a warm summer's night in the South of England or in warmer parts of the continent, when their aroma is most prevalent in the ever so slightly humid and warm air at about 2 am. The memories of those smells always leave my lungs full of the air breathed in of those blooms, and en exhale that is the result of a very happy and satisfied soul.I have had this on for a full day's wear, and I only had a full single spray on one arm, which I then added another spray to a few hours later. This is so well blended that I just do not detect any cinnamon, Musk, Vanilla or even the Osmanthus, but I do notice the Osmanthus through the peachy, leathery feel to the fragrance, which just simply further defines the Tuberose to meI'm on one with Bisch, I've grabbed Tilia, B683 Extrait (again), I already have and love Hibiscus Mahajád, and needless to say love his other Marc-Antoinne Barrois masterpieces. This is a must add to the collection of anyone that loves Tuberose and non-indolic Jasmine and Honeysuckle. It is ever so slightly feminine leaning, but has whiffs of masculinity floating about, that cement it in the unisex arena.I'd personally wear this anywhere, all day, and mostly in warmer weather, but to be honest, it's a very happy and delightful smell, that akin to his Tilia, I can wear anytime, and is not really gender specific. Full bottle worthy and dare I say a safe blind buy? yes, in my books, 100%UPDATE: I've been wearing this now for 4 days straight, from morning till night. I'm absolutely addicted to this fragrance.

It's incredibly strong in both projection and lasting power, and my first thought was that the strentgth of this perfume lies in amber or ambroxan, because I feel like I get quite a heavy dose of something akin to that, but neither are listed in the official note breakdown on Maison Crivelli website (bit more skeptical about the fragrantica note breakdowns, often inaccurate). Perhaps it's the synthetic leather note, but it's warm, a little bit animalic and very sharp. The cinnamon and osmanthus are kind of there, but very much in the background, not very sweet or fruity at all; I get maybe just a small dose of that coumarine spicyness. But what I do get quite a lot is the carrot seed - the strange vegetal sweetness, earthiness and some greenery. That's what makes this scent so odd. I almost forget that this is a floral perfume, because I truthfully don't get that much of tuberose in here, maybe in the opening, but very brief.I am not necessarily sure this would be good to wear out in the public, except for modern art exhibitions and slam poetry readings (that's the feeling I get from this), but as a piece of art, I very much admire it."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Crivelli/Tubereuse-Astrale-90733.html,Tubéreuse Astrale Maison Crivelli perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Updated review: I love so many perfumes by Bisch but this one was a big time regretful blind buy on my part. I recently realized this is due to the leather note that isn’t listed here. Whatever this new vegan leather note is that they’re putting in all the new releases over the past couple years is truly the most horrible note to my nose I’ve ever encountered in perfumery. I’m not even being a drama queen here, it just is extremely noticeable and the only scent that truly makes me want to scrub it off, and I’ve smelled at least a thousand perfumes in my life. It smothers all other notes and my nose cannot smell anything else. It smells nothing like leather to me (I wear a lot of leather in the winter) and nothing like leather in older scents I’ve tried. This new fake leather seems reminiscent of the new car smell of plastic off gassing (which is a scent that has made me very car sick ever since childhood) mixed with a fake woodsy note, sprayed with a medical disinfectant. It actually turns my stomach. This is the same note that I believe others here are referring to as burnt tires and/or petrol. This same leather note in TA is dominant in Ganymede, Babycat, and Liquide by Liquides Imaginaries. I blind bought 3 FBs of these scents wondering what was wrong with my nose and where did all my money go. I must be overly sensitive to the fake leather chemical. I just cannot stand to smell it and it’s the only perfume note to date that actually makes me ill, and it does so in every perfume that uses it regardless of the brand or designer.I will say the drydown of Tubereuse Astrale once the leather note fades (after 6-8 hours+) reminds me of a simplified version of the drydown of Gaultiers Divine, also by Bisch, so if you’re looking for a sweet unique floral that lacks the leather note and stays a bit more mainstream, you may want to sample Divine. If you’re looking for a sweet girly leather type scent, Bisch also recently designed Teriaq by Lataffa which uses a different type of leather note (or it’s designed in a way that is unrecognizable to my nose) and that one is very sexy and enjoyable to me."

Of course, if you are looking for a beast, quite unisex, tuberose scent with a lot of character and a bit of darkness, this is definitely worth trying.EDIT:I bought it in the end and I love it so much!"

Call me old fashioned but I like my perfumes to be a pleasant journey throughout. I don't need it to smell like gasoline or fumes or for it to go through a challenging opening stage in order to enjoy the beauty of its dry down. Funnily enough, I like the first minute of this: big stalks of tuberoses. Modern and metallic. Cooling yet creamy at the same time. But after a few minutes, TA becomes a sweet, fruity drink. It may be the osmanthus (a note I'm not very fond of). I just found the whole thing to be harsh and garish. Is Quentin spreading himself thin, I wonder? Not my place to say but his latest releases are feeling rushed to me. I kind of have an issue with ""niche"" houses started by ""creative directors"" who all seemingly hire the same noses.

The notes sound so chaotic but everything here is SO beautifully blended. The cinnamon gives this beautiful, light warmth without being headache-inducing. The osmanthus avoids that juvenile too-sweet dried-fruit vibe. The only thing I don't get here, strangely, is the tuberose. I really don't smell tuberose at all - looks like I'll have to revisit the store and sample it on skin again ;) Not animalic and I don't get gasoline, but I can see why one would have that vibe. If anyone has smelled Imitation Woman by Amouage and the way the blackcurrant is done, you have some people saying you like the vibe and others saying it smells like cat urine - something in here (is it the cinnamon plus osmanthus) is giving me a SLIGHT nod to the way Imitation Woman smells, but nothing urinal here at all.Not a safe blind buy (I don't think any of the Maison Crivellis nor the Quentin Bisch creations are safe) - and even if you like tuberose, you should really test this before buying it.Vibe: fuzzy, soft, barely peach-coloured nudePolarity: leans feminineLongevity: lasted beyond 2 showers on my skinProjection: monstrous (I turned anosmic in the store but the blotter card perfumed my house for a week)"

How to put this one into words….. On my skin, as it goes on I get the most beastly fumes of tires and petrol with a hint of tuberose, only just a hint. It’s totally off putting at first.After some time, after it has dried down the tuberose starts to take over more but I get Jasmine more than tuberose. So odd. Still there’s a lingering whiff of fuel and rubber, I don’t know how else to describe it.At the 6 hour mark it’s all tuberose and it is truly exquisite! At 10 hours it’s still going strong, incredible performance.But, I don’t want to wait 6 hours to get the real beauty of this fragrance so it’s a no for me."

I disliked Gozo and had to declutter. This I really enjoyed at first sniff. This is a creamy animalic tuberose scent. The tuberose doesn’t go into that bubblegum territory that I hate. The cinnamon is blended smoothly. I actually didn’t get that note at first sniff. I will have to test again.

You would definitely induce headaches or put people off if you oversprayed.But on the whole, I couldn't stop sniffing my wrist and I really liked the scent that lingered around me for about 8 hours for the single spray!It's clearly not a people pleaser judging by the reviews but I think if you're a big tuberose fan, it's probably a winner!"

The sum of all of this usually results in novel scents that pair the function and wearability of a classic with the genius verve of an artist. Tubereuse Astrale reads along the lines of something Barrois would just-about turn down for being too garish - a racy space station tuberose - yet when positioned in the Crivelli stable, fits like a dove joint with their other barnstorming offerings. Its playful, loud, bubblegum florals are at one with the perfume's Ganymede-like aura and I love its raucous, brash attitude.

This fragrance is intricate and rich.From the initial spray, the scent captivates with a prominent tuberose note, intricately laced with a hint of vanilla, marking its complexity right from the start. The evolution of its scent profile is remarkable, transitioning through various phases that reveal the depth and breadth of its formulation. For over 6-7 hours, I'm enveloped by the scent of Osmanthus, reminiscent of suede, a testament to its multifaceted nature. By morning, it transforms into a creamy, lactonic tuberose, having journeyed through an intense, emotional landscape overnight. Tubéreuse Astrale by Maison Crivelli is a formidable blend that stands out for its dynamic shifts and the strong emotional response it invokes."

Not a fan unfortunately.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Crivelli/Tubereuse-Astrale-90733.html,Tubéreuse Astrale Maison Crivelli perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Hmm. This is a game attempt at a unisex tuberose, but I ultimately find it falls a little flat. The fragrantica notes list is, in my view, mostly irrelevent - there's a lot going on in this perfume, and most of it isn't written down.The tuberose presented is of the 'bubblegum' variety but, to my nose, it's set on a bedrock of woods and spices which pulls the whole thing away from a traditionally feminine scent. Conceptionally, I'd say so far, so good.The problem is that this base is also rather lacking in subtlety or uniqueness - it's a sledgehammer of different accords - wood, musk, spices, something fairly oudy etc. Everything is shouting to be heard. It's left for the tuberose to try and rear its head above the din now and again (which, in fairness, it does).If you're after yet another middle-eastern themed woody base, you may enjoy this one. I just find it a little bit overplayed.Not Bisch's best work, but given that he has such a backlog of great scents behind him already, it hardly matters.If you're after something unique and beautiful from this range, I'd be looking towards Patchouli Magnetik - definitely one of the best releases of recent years."

There is so much in this fragrance. Seems simple, but it is extremely complex. Sweet, bubblegummy tuberose and strong leather in the first few minutes. After that, the leather blends in, stays in the background, and the flowers start to dance: yes, the osmanthus brings freshness. Sometimes I feel like its almost a little minty, makes the bubblegum feeling stronger. A blink of an eye and it becomes super creamy, lactonic tuberose. Another blink and I feel some sweet spices, lead by cinnamon. Also sometimes I get a little bit os Petit Fracas kind of vibe. Soooooo complex and beautiful. Also very very strong, sillage is a monster, and it lasts like...forever. You have to be careful with the amount you use."

However fragrantica neglects to put all the notes in their pyramids and in the mid is tuberose, osmanthus and carrot seeds.The mixture in the mid between the carrot and the tuberose is incredibly off putting. I kept trying to place the scent and then I realized it is straight up baby food carrots.

Maison Crivelli has shown that extraits are not for the weak. This will last days on you clothes. I feel like this will stain your lighter colored clothes so beware.

Its basically a bubble gum tuberose blast!dry down notes: This dries down to something very powdery, slightly tuberose and floral, its vanilla - its the powderiness that reminds me of many frags that are trending (like a trail of angelique noir, babycat, black tie) kind of powdery.This is nuclear (just as strong/stronger) than ombre nomade.Well its clear. Maison Crivelli has shown that extraits are not for the weak. This will last days on you clothes. I feel like this will stain your lighter colored clothes so beware. I bought a bottle, worth it in my opinion. I'm not sure about others but I love this as a guy and its definitely a unique head turner. I think this needs some time and will blow up as well. 9/10 in my opinion."

A masterpiece again from MISTER BISCH. A Lovely tuberose wrapped in spicy notes, i also smell the cinnamon with a soft leather. To my nose the smell is not at all too sweet, just the right amount of sweetness. I can't stop smelling my wrist it's such a addictive scent to me. I absolutely love it. Like most scents of Quentin Bisch they can be unusual but i love that."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Crivelli/Tubereuse-Astrale-90733.html,Tubéreuse Astrale Maison Crivelli perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Updated review: I love so many perfumes by Bisch but this one was a big time regretful blind buy on my part. I recently realized this is due to the leather note that isn’t listed here. Whatever this new vegan leather note is that they’re putting in all the new releases over the past couple years is truly the most horrible note to my nose I’ve ever encountered in perfumery. I’m not even being a drama queen here, it just is extremely noticeable and the only scent that truly makes me want to scrub it off, and I’ve smelled at least a thousand perfumes in my life. It smothers all other notes and my nose cannot smell anything else. It smells nothing like leather to me (I wear a lot of leather in the winter) and nothing like leather in older scents I’ve tried. This new fake leather seems reminiscent of the new car smell of plastic off gassing (which is a scent that has made me very car sick ever since childhood) mixed with a fake woodsy note, sprayed with a medical disinfectant. It actually turns my stomach. This is the same note that I believe others here are referring to as burnt tires and/or petrol. This same leather note in TA is dominant in Ganymede, Babycat, and Liquide by Liquides Imaginaries. I blind bought 3 FBs of these scents wondering what was wrong with my nose and where did all my money go. I must be overly sensitive to the fake leather chemical. I just cannot stand to smell it and it’s the only perfume note to date that actually makes me ill, and it does so in every perfume that uses it regardless of the brand or designer.I will say the drydown of Tubereuse Astrale once the leather note fades (after 6-8 hours+) reminds me of a simplified version of the drydown of Gaultiers Divine, also by Bisch, so if you’re looking for a sweet unique floral that lacks the leather note and stays a bit more mainstream, you may want to sample Divine. If you’re looking for a sweet girly leather type scent, Bisch also recently designed Teriaq by Lataffa which uses a different type of leather note (or it’s designed in a way that is unrecognizable to my nose) and that one is very sexy and enjoyable to me."

I love tuberose and the pyramid here led me to believe it would be a fairly safe blind buy, I was wrong. Despite the name, this is not a tuberose-leaning fragrance. To my nose, this is an extremely animalic, spicy, masculine musk. This is not a feminine tuberose scent. I am so glad this came with samples, I am definitely returning it."

Tuberose I don’t get at all, except for a short nod in the opening. The rest of its run features a sour note that to my nose starts interesting but definitely overstays its welcome and turns into something vaguely reminiscent of vomit. I sprayed this on my wrists three days ago and am now bringing my coat to the dry-cleaner because I can’t stand this smell anymore!"

As a gourmand lover, I don't find this as super sweet as other people here think it is, and it definitely isn't a gourmand (edible) scent after the opening. It opens with a sweet watermelon (which I enjoy), but then the coconut and musk start to dominate and it starts to smell like sweet and salty sunscreen, which is a little reminiscent of sweet body odour. If this was a fresh watermelon with citrus or aquatic notes, I would buy a full bottle. As it is, I get whiffs of this during the day and I don't love what I am smelling, it's not bad but it's also not full bottle worthy."

Opens with sweet watermelon and bright citrus. The creamy coconut comes in and warms things up. starts to dry down with the amber and hint of cacao. Very Aquatic and airy. Its pretty. uplifting and young scent profile. The sweetness gives off a faint almost floral even without any floral notes. softens a bit musky slight powder on the dry-down, close to the skin. Very beachy; warm sun and sand feeling. Very easy reach in the warm season. I enjoyed this for a watermelon fragrance, its really nice; blended beautifully. (I don't usually do watermelon)."

It really does smell like a pack of jolly ranchers or watermelon gum. I was expecting something slightly sweet but more fresh and watery but I don’t get that at all. Just watermelon flavored candy. I can’t see myself wearing this in the summer either because I feel like the sweetness would be too overbearing in the heat.

Not much depth or complexity but it's such a fun, bright summer scent.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Room-1015/Wavechild-91364.html,Wavechild Room 1015 perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I find this to be a lovely SUMMER fragrance. Summer, and only summer... perhaps end of spring when people start considering it summer anyway, but that's.. about it! Of course, I do find most fragrances to lean some way or another, but this is truly a one season only scent for me! I very much ENJOY this fragrance... it's fun, light, and super duper summery!! That said, as much as I do love it, I am in agreement with the comments saying that it's more like a body spray... truly, it really is something I'd expect from a body spray! And while there is nothing wrong with that, I do find most body sprays to smell lovely, it just becomes problematic in relation to the price. That said, when it eventually becomes discounted, I would be likely to pick up a bottle as long as the longevity EXCEEDS that of a body spray!! To be honest with you, I am expecting that there will probably be an Arabic dupe of this available in the not-to-distant future.. it would be easy to clone, and even though I am usually not a clone person, I think in this instance it would likely be as rich and complex as the original which... I don't find wavechild to have much depth. Again though, I wish to emphasize that I AM a fan, and I DO like it!I love the watermelon in this fragrance, I enjoy it much more than the other watermelon fragrance (Arabic) that I've heard so much about (and own, but it has the staying power of a body wash sadly). I typically avoid fragrances with coconut, but in this case I think it works really well. Is not sunscreeny at all, the coconut isn't overpowering or making me think the fragrance is tropical. Which I love tropical, but there are so many tropical summer fragrances. I love that Wavechild is summery without being tropical, I feel like I see that a lot less!It is such a lovely fragrance for summer, though it is borderline juvenile. That hasn't stopped me in the past though!! Personally, I have such a difficult time finding summer fragrances, even fragrances that are widely praised as being for summer... don't work for me all the time! So, I'm happy with this, and I will feel okay about buying a full bottle sometime in the future, discounted! Smells like a freshly sliced watermelon."

The watermelon is synthetic but not in a bad way, initially I found it a bit cloying. BUT THEN, this creaminess from the coconut come in and smoothes the tooth achingly sweet watermelon down. That’s when it becomes wearable and delicious; the cloying-ness fades and you are left with something quite nice. I have an 8ml decant and that will do because it’s not a scent I’d reach for often but it is nice. As the weather warms up this could rank higher for me; I’d give it a 7/10.

I imagine it would smell pretty good after swimming in the ocean/sea and the remnants of salt on your skin cut through that sweetness (or maybe layered with an ambroxan/iso-e type scent?!) Has the potential to do wonders, depending on your taste and body chemistry."

I would describe the scent as sugered warm watermelon with some shampoo vibes in a very classy way. It is a true happy scent, I really enjoy wearing it and thinking about getting a bottle. A very inoffensive, even Office friendly daytime fragrance. My twin sister does not seem to like it and it appears the opinions are different, so better test before blind-buying."

I didn't hate this frag, but the watermelon note was a touch screechy to me. The ozonic and coconut notes in this frag in particular are great, but the sugary sweetness of the watermelon ended up dominating this scent, and mixed with the citrusy top notes I ended up with a bit of a headache.I've got a sample of this so I'm tempted to try this again when I'm on holiday and see if the frag is a bit better in even warmer/sunnier climates, but unfortunately it's definitely not working for me at home."

I was expecting the watermelon to be more photorealistic (melon-y, sweet, and aquatic), however the watermelon in Wave Child is more of a juvenile candy watermelon scent. The notes are all detectable which is nice, but they do awkwardly compete against one another. Particularly the opening citrus, melon, and cacao.I would love for this to be reformulated with a more photorealistic watermelon accord. The candy-like synthetic watermelon makes me strike this one out as a fragrance that I would actually wear."

This is surprisingly fresh and pleasant, a bit similar to Melon Kiss by Navitus except with watermelon instead of honeydew melon. The drydown is not so pleasant, where it seems poorly blended and you get watery remains of watermelon rind with amber and cacao."

As it dried down, I got a very salty oceanic note, probably from the type of ambergris that they used. I usually love salty notes, but this went in a dirty ocean water direction that I had to wash off. I do not like marine scents at all, so I guess I should not be surprised. I usually like ambergris notes, though. So glad that I sampled this one first. If you enjoy salty aquatic scents, you will likely enjoy it much more than I did."

But something in the long run is making me relieved I didn’t blind buy a fb.It’s more watermelon nerds than a ripe, juicy piece of the real thing, but that’s not what had me scrubbing.

He has trouble smelling things and hardly ever comments on my fragrances, so I was surprised. He agreed that it smells mainly like watermelon, but the projection seems to bother him a bit. This was with 4 sprays. Usually he loves watermelon and other fruity scents, so I think the ambergris is what’s bothering him."

This is a nice scent if you like something that's bright, youthful, and fruit punch-esque. I feel like this is not too unique of a scent, and you can easily find a body spray or body lotion that smells a lot like it, as the coconut and melon notes are the most prominent. The aquatic, citrusy mandarin notes follow immediately after when smelling it directly on your skin. The cacao is also noticeable in the waft. not my style, but it's a cute summer time scent which can easily be found for less.update: 18 hours later and it is still noticeable on my skin.

Juicy, tangy goodness. Others have complained about a synthetic quality, and I can't argue. I personally don't think synethic-smelling notes are altogether evil when it comes to fragrance.

Opening is watermelon candy, like many others have said here. After the opening I get the coconut and cacao and then it turns aquatic and back to the watermelon again. Not ozonic or citrusy at all, according to me. Sweet, fruity, bubblegum and aquatic is what I would say.Unfortunately, it's not that usable for me personally. It is unisex but I would say slightly more feminine than masculine. Well blended, good longevity and amazing price for a 100 ML niche fragrance. If you're looking for a unique summer fragrance that will turn heads, go for this one!"

Soon after you get the citrus, amber and coconut which grounds the scent to something more beautiful and calm. It then transforms into a soft watermelon coconut that stays close to the skin, and the scent fades quite a bit, leaving you with a moderate sillage. It makes me feel like I'm on the huge balcony of a house that's right against the beach, it's a super hot day and I'm laying there in the sun, watching the waves and eating a big bowl of chopped watermelon with shredded coconut. It's nothing fancy or fantastic, but I absolutely love it. I've smelled nothing like this before and have decided this will be my summer signature."

It's so much fun. It smells like freshly opened Nerds sweets, washed down with watermelon juice and then swiftly followed by a coconut and chocolate icecream bought from a kiosk on the shore. It really is a surf bombshell, but one who was not so recently a pink princess. Just hilarious, good-natured and a very good time. Bizarrely artistic and evocative, despite its bubble-gummy vibe. A ten, honestly. With Sonic Flower also being a love, I'm quickly coming to rate and respect Room 1015.IG: ScentAWeek"

I put Batikh watermelon on top of Wavechild and I got a great outcome.... But why would I need such an expensive perfume to top it with $20 one in order for it to smell good...It Melon kiss smells anything similar to Wavechild, I definitely glad I have not bought it."

I always bought the watermelon lollipop from the corner store in NY since when I could remember up until high-school. Never knew the name but just looked it up and it's the Alberts Big Slice Pop. This smells like the juicy red watermelon and tart green watermelon lollipops both fused together. They also had a blue one but that's irrelevant here lol. Room 1015 Wavechild is very hard-candy in the opening with a sea breeze accord from the ambergris in the late opening with nuances of watery light citruses.There's this creaminess in the back that I want to attribute to the coconut even though that's not the most obvious note. Like a coconut light parfait that doesn't blend with the candied watermelon in the beginning but provides support to the overall fragrance so it's not just a bright candy. As it dries, it does come to the front, blending its texture more with the watermelon. The more I smell it in the dry down, the more I love this and the coconut that comes forward. I'm not sure if the cacao also contributes to the coconut smell, but I am sure that this is fun, playful, and very summer or most year if you live in a hotter climate. This performs moderate on me."

Something similar could be found in escada for example. It is not at all as Vanilla Vibes - the profiles are completely different, and Vanilla Vibes definitely sound more interesting and richer (in comparison). No durability.

More than pear gelato, it reminds me of the drumstick sweets I used to have as a kid. It’s juicy sweet, but not overly sweet. Delightful and a need for the gourmand lovers!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Theodoros-Kalotinis/Pear-Gelato-92249.html,Pear Gelato Theodoros Kalotinis perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"The opening is absolutely delicious and realistic. You can totally smell the pear, the creaminess and coolness of the gelato and the waffle. This fragrance just has one fatal flaw: it literally lasts one minute and then it vanishes. And I'm not being hyperbolic. I mean LITERALLY. One minute. Poof! Gone! (At least on my skin, obviously). I have to bury my nose on my skin to get a faint whiff of that pear, and it doesn't even smell that amazingly mouthwatering anymore.That being said, I sprayed it on some tissue in the living room when I received it, and I kept getting yummy wafts of it whenever I walked through that room. So I honestly don't know what kind of cruel trick is my skin playing on me, but I hate it. I don't know if I should keep this and keep using it as room fragrance or to gift it to someone whose skin is not a prankster."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Theodoros-Kalotinis/Pear-Gelato-92249.html,Pear Gelato Theodoros Kalotinis perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I love TK fragrances and pear is one of my favorite scents, but I really hesitated with this one. Some reviewers says, that it would be a bright, childish pear, with poor performance...... still, I decided to blindly trust the brand, some experienced Tube-nose, and, oh Boys, How happy, that I did! The pear really shines in this fragrance! The scent doesn't lose the pear, even when the wonderful cream waffle becomes more and more prominent, making the scent very deep and rich. Even so deep, that for a nanosecond, I imagined find oud there. But no, there is nothing woody about the scent, the note of the pastry is only as dense. Amazing.I don't have a problem with performance either. For me, the scent dries into a shallow, but nice, deep skinscent, that lasts with me for a really commendable 4-5 hours. So delicious."

They are refreshing, fruity and sweet. This fragrance smells like someone put a melted perenijsje in a bottle, added some milk and vanilla, then crushed a waffle cone and added a sprinkle of that too. It's a photorealistic sweetened pear icecream. It's in a nice glass cup though, and the waffle is added as a garnish that scoop some icecream with and eat first, because that note disappears while the milky vanilla pear is what lingers. It really smells like food, not like perfume. It's yummy, although I'm not sure if I would wear it, but that's personal taste. The realistic fruit gets a little too sickly sweet for me, but I'm going to try layering with the decant that I have.This is definitely a very beautiful and special fragrance, that radiates at a modest arms length and last for a good couple of hours."

Wholesome, sweet, cute, youthful and simple. Feels like i’m dripping in exactly what it says - creamy, milky, mellow pear gelato. No punchy fruit notes, no cloying creams, just a delicious ice cream during a summer’s evening down a cobbled street on holiday. I think this is definitely a spring/summer leaning scent, but this is my new signature all rounder as a gourmand girl. Delightful 💚 🍦"

Your vanilla soft serve takes a tumble and melts on the asphalt, sun beaming down on your cheeks. That’s what this perfume feels like to me — the sweet treat after the picnic on the hottest day of the summer, the melted cone on the asphalt, picking from the juiciest pears at the farmer’s market. It’s a summer gourmand for the adult that’s walking hand in hand with their inner child."

It quickly settles into a warm, sugary scent that reminds me of a freshly baked pie crust dusted with cinnamon and sugar. The fragrance isn’t overly sweet or heavy like some gourmands; instead, it has a delicate, soft dry down with hints of creamy vanilla mixed with pear. It’s light and airy, bringing to mind fragrances like Tease Crème Cloud or Ariana Grande’s Cloud, but with its own unique twist. If you’re into fruity scents that aren’t too literal or overwhelming, this one’s a lovely choice."

My only downside is I find it doesn't last very long on my skin and doesn't project much (but I could be going anosmic).If you like pear and sweet perfumes you need this!!!

My husband is a huge fan of this one because he loves pears. Sadly, Pear Gelato only lasts for 2 hours on me before fading into a nondescript sweet skin scent. I really wish this had the longevity and projection of TK's extrait de parfum Creme Brûlée, which smells gorgeous and also lasts and projects like a beast for 8+ hours, because then for sure I would buy a full bottle."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Theodoros-Kalotinis/Pear-Gelato-92249.html,Pear Gelato Theodoros Kalotinis perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I am addicted to smelling this! Very lactonic sweet gelato with a really fresh bright pear running through. When I say it’s very lactonic I mean I get like almost a yogurty, cheesecake vibe from this. I know that sounds weird! but it doesn’t cross the line of being offensive and still lives within the realm of being an edible, dessert gourmand. The pear is really bright and sparkling and crisp. Waffle note is slightly toasted. Everything blends nicely. I do get the impression of an ice cream shop, or maybe a fancy latte, roasted pistachios and almonds whipped cream. Of course not all of these are l actual notes but first few times I sniffed this before buying I really thought it was a pistachio latte fragrance despite the name lol. All in all I love it, smells so good. Price point is great, others have mentioned longevity is bad and unfortunately it is. This lasts like an hour on skin, and maybe 3 on clothes? It becomes very faint."

But when you sniff it, it's like you burying your face into a very fluffy pillow and it's hot and hard to breathe, if that makes sense.Going back to the artificial bit, after it dried out on my skin, the smell reminded me of a mosquito repellant spray. Which is all a shame, because the way it was described really made my head spin. :^("

There is some type of light nuttiness in this perfume.

Very meh and pretty synthetic to my nose. I also got a sample of Creme Brûlée and wondered if I grabbed the wrong sample b/c the vanilla was so dominant.

On application and in the bottle I'm getting a lot of butter (?) jumping out at me, it's almost repulsive. I think it may be the waffle cone. The pear is so weak to my nose that I was second guessing if I was even smelling the right perfume. I don't get pear ice-cream at all, this is very much a warm vanilla-y gourmand. I was really excited for this one for the summer, but it's nothing special or something I'd see myself reaching for."

It's what I expected from Kayalis Pistachio yum but this is more sophisticated with more simplified, but also more complex notes compared to kayalis that has way too much notes to even be able to separate them from each other. Pear Gelato Is just what it sounds like. A pear gelato you bought at an ice cream shop somewhere in warm, southern Europe. Easy to wear, very realistic, nostalgic and just perfect. Intoxicating. The lesser the notes the better in my opinion. Definitely recommend this! 5/5"

The pear in this is fresh, (not candied or super ripe) fresh and covered in sweet lactonic creamy vanilla goodness. First spray I was thrown off by how lactonic and I didn’t think I liked it. Came back the next day to try it again and more prepared for that bright lactonic and waffle cone opening and was pleasantly surprised. I REALLY like this now, I’d give it an 8/10!

It's light and airy the way a summer gourmand would be. Fitting for beach days and well layerable since the scent is faint, but nothing that simply spraying more on won't fix. (Don't let the three spritz warriors fool you)I love milk scents as well and similarly see through the spoiled milk and synthetic comments cause that waffle cone is present in a sneaky way that makes it smell a little weird straight out of the box.In the end, it's a pleasant vision of hand-scooped sherbet dripping down the slowly softening wafflecone.

My boyfriend and I both smell pear yogurt from this, but in a nice way. There is some sweetness that I associate with the waffle cone. It is somehow synthetic-smelling but also kind of realistic. It's an interesting one for sure. I am not sure how this will fare in the summer as it is pretty sweet, but it's not crazy strong either.

I dont actually get much pear.. i get a very sugary sweet nondescript fruit with just a hint of a thin milk gelato type note mixed with vanilla and maybe just a whisper of waffle/butter/caramel. Very, very sweet. And i dont mind sweet scents (think love don't be shy, la belle, oriana, etc.) but the sweetness in this just seems very artificial.

Not much pear, mostly vanilla and not a good vanilla at that. Everything combined makes for a strange, cheap smell and is very synthetic. This is not how I like my gourmands to be. Only good thing about it is that it doesn’t last long. I had to laugh at the review that said “Smells like Whey protein Vanilla pear” … I was going to mention that myself because yeah it does smell a bit like my vanilla whey protein powder and I would know, I’ve been drinking whey protein 2x a day for the last 10 years lol."

I was very intrigued and excited about this new release but at the same time I was afraid because this is a risky kind of scent, as in the past I was rather disappointed with other pear scent. Also, description made me wonder if it would smell like that synthetic pear flavoured carbonated soft drink, which I was never a fan of. Or perhaps some artificially scented pear flavoured ice cream, not of the highest quality. But what I've got with this Pear Gelato defied all my fears and completely blew me away. It is such a beautiful, delicious, incredible mastefuly crafted scent! Yes, I get that clear pear taste/flavor and it stays through the wear. It is not entirely like an actual plain fruit, but rather like a flavour in a candy or desert, but not artificial or too strong or too fresh - this is not a sorbet. Instead, this is a very creamy, perfectly laconic ice-cream. Like that delicious spoonful of ice-cream that is on the pint of melting, so creamy, laatonic, sweet and delicious. It is sweet, but I think still fully wearable on a warmer day. The pear is not sickly sweet. It is not a beast, no monstrous sillage but does last and gives a lot of comfort. Love it! Any gourmand lover should be intrigued!"

Do you remember?🍐This was the perfumer's inspiration and Pear Gelato gives me exactly this vibe. I find it a bit girly, a playful scent for spring and summer days, vacation in a bottle🌴I can imagine, even guess, this being The scent worn by beautiful teenagers to flirt with the guys after the beach in the local gelateria🍦Now, talking about myself... Will I reach for it often? With total honesty: No, it's way too sweet and girly for me🥹but it will be nice on holidays🌴The best part of the perfume? Despite some said they don't get it, I do: The waffle note🧇It's very prominent and I love it🤍I can predict it will be a hit this season among the youngest! Projection is moderate, can't tell about longevity or dry down yet because I've just received it and sprayed it on my skin less than an hour ago😋"

This pear gelato perfume is very sweet and gourmande just like how I imagined it to be. A lot of pear and definitely waffle cone with a bit of vanilla!

Unfortunatelly is not what i expected. The pear is there but its not as fresh as the fruit smells , the vanilla is too strong and honestly ruins it for me with that much of sweetness. I live in Greece and bought it thinking this would be a great fresh/fruity perfume but i think with all the summer heat will be unbearable. I will wait to wear it again from autumn to winter and see it the smell is different."

Still artificial sweetness all the way.Good thing in my case : last for short sliver of time (1 nauseating hour followed by 1 tolerable hour).I'm curious about all the good reviews below though.

More waffle cone up top pear comes through shortly thereafter. It’s gourmand but not overly so. I’m not sure how it will feel in the heat of summer but for spring and early summer it perfect. I got two other of the four releases on the strength of this and so far Cherry Powder is special too. I’ll grab Crème Brûlée for fall.

I love Theodoros Kalotinis (coffee addict is one of my favorite) but I think I prefer Lemon Tart over this but I must say that Pear Gelato has better performance than Lemon Tart.

It's light and airy the way a summer gourmand would be. Fitting for beach days and well layerable since the scent is faint, but nothing that simply spraying more on won't fix. (Don't let the three spritz warriors fool you)I love milk scents as well and similarly see through the spoiled milk and synthetic comments cause that waffle cone is present in a sneaky way that makes it smell a little weird straight out of the box.In the end, it's a pleasant vision of hand-scooped sherbet dripping down the slowly softening wafflecone. It's good for the price especially so I really can't complain"

It's a lot more sugary sweet, synthetic smelling than I thought it would be. I dont actually get much pear.. i get a very sugary sweet nondescript fruit with just a hint of a thin milk gelato type note mixed with vanilla and maybe just a whisper of waffle/butter/caramel. Very, very sweet. And i dont mind sweet scents (think love don't be shy, la belle, oriana, etc.) but the sweetness in this just seems very artificial. I'm so disappointed i was SO excited for this as everyone on youtube has been raving about this AND the price is great. If i had smelled before, I would not have purchased."

But when you sniff it, it's like you burying your face into a very fluffy pillow and it's hot and hard to breathe, if that makes sense.Going back to the artificial bit, after it dried out on my skin, the smell reminded me of a mosquito repellant spray.

The scent is reminiscent of a light, clean body lotion, giving off an airy, sun-kissed vibe that feels incredibly refreshing.The fragrance opens with a burst of crisp bergamot and neroli, followed by the creamy richness of tiare and ylang ylang. Coconut and vanilla add a subtle warmth, but it’s the overall effect of the fragrance that truly stands out. It feels like a clean, light-scented body lotion, evoking memories of sunny days and beachside relaxation. The result is a fragrance that’s both elegant and effortlessly easy to wear."

It took me awhile to figure it out, though: Yves Rocher Monoï oil! The only difference is that Goddess starts out with a slight citrus smell which, however, is so faint and fleeting that one might miss it. I like the smell but I'm not shelling out 250€ for a scent that has already been around for decades and which I can (and want to) use only a few days a year. Because I'm loath to slather myself in oil just to smell like a Goddess, I ordered the YR Monoï Body Spray which smells exactly like the oil. Now I'm happily sun-goddessing on the cheap through the hottest days of summer"

I was so wrong about this being linear, she just needed the right environment! Warm and humid climates make this fragrance open up into something so beautiful and more complex.

It's warm, sensual, sweet - vastly better than TF Soleil anything. I WANTED to be so in love with this. And it's ok. The quality is there for this kind of scent, I think it's a very well done tropical floral blast of summer heat, sunscreen, sweetness and sun warmed skin on the beach. But there's something about it that keeps me from wanting to keep my nose buried in my wrist. I'll keep trying my sample, maybe on my skin I should try a different season (though it IS July)."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/By-Kilian/Sunkissed-Goddess-90336.html,Sunkissed Goddess By Kilian perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"If you're comparing this to Tom Ford Soleil Blanc, you desperately need to get your nostrils cleaned and your brain rewired.Comparing this to Tom Ford is uninspired, nonsensical, and odd. The presence of ylang ylang, bergamot, and coconut do not makes these two fragrances close enough for meaningful comparison. That would be like me comparing Soleil Blanc to Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato 33 just because both have pistachio, jasmine, and tonka bean notes. Buffoonery. I get that they're both solars, but it is immediately obvious that both are trying to do very different things.Sunkissed Goddess is very much a sweet, indulgent solar while Soleil Blanc is undoubtedly spicier and fresher. I would recommend this perfume to the gourmand girls who want a sweet and sunny perfume for the summer. This perfume has an intense suntan/sunscreen lotion oilness that I personally find delicious. The tiare is the star of this fragrance, and immediately reminded me of the NARS Monoi line (specifically their Monoi candle which was incredible but has now been discontinued).This perfume feels sensual in a ""lounge, flirt, and tan under the Hawaiian sun all day but never actually go into the water"" type of way. The oiliness that I mentioned earlier is definitely one of my favorite qualities in a solar fragrance and makes me wish this was an actual oil that I could slather all over my body for the summer. That, paired with the buttery and creaminess of the coconut makes this feel like a sweet treat. I do think the sweetness can be polarizing on different people's skin, so go test this out at Sephora before you drop $295 on this.The nearest comparison I can make to this perfume is Terracotta by Guerlain. They smell differently initially, but after 3-4 hours on the skin they both impart a very sensual warmth. I thought Aloha Tiare EDT by Comptoir Sud Pacifique might be comparable, but that one has a horrific dirtiness to it."

I stay away from summer perfumes since I can’t stand to smell like sunscreen, the beach, or coconut. However, this perfume is so different. There’s a whisper of “summertime” within this fragrance, but it doesn’t completely smell like the beach. I get a lot of white and yellow florals. It smells kind of like marshmallows, too. The same sweetness that’s present in LDBS definitely peeks through in this fragrance. It smells like a warm, sugary and lactonic yellow floral blend. I love this so much. Can’t wait to purchase the full size. If you’re a gourmand lover, but don’t enjoy spicy scents, this is for you. It’s very soft, feminine, and definitely gives summer vibes, minus the poolside sunscreen."

This has good sillage but is fresh and not cloying at all even though it's a white floral, they are usually not my favorite. It immediately transported me back to my favorite holiday destination.

No depth at all. It doesn’t smell bad but why would one pay these kind of prices for a scent profile you can buy for much cheaper is beyond me. This smells like your average run of the mill summer tiare perfume honestly. These types of perfumes aren’t my favorite I’ll admit but I’d suggest Montale’s intense tiare over this because not only can you get it for much cheaper, it also has way better performance and longevity. I used to own it and it got me compliments all the time in the summer months despite not being a fav of mine to wear. Sunkissed goddess is so weak, blink and you miss it. I’ve been so disappointed with Kilian fragrances lately, they used to be so good.I got an email recently regarding a price increase for Kilian fragrances, what a joke."

It’s kind of a if you have one you have them all situation. I just needed way more of the tiare flower than what came through. The lack of tropical-ness other reviewers have noted is spot on. It’s much more of a trip to the local pool packed with families emanating the smell of sunscreen, than a 5 star resort in Bora Bora vibe, at least to me. I was so sure I’d love Sunkissed Goddess, but let’s be honest the name was probably half the reason why I was convinced of that."

CSLY made me feel sick, and this brought that experience back, and I do have a hard time with Ylang, but I can’t really pick that up, so that isn’t the issue. This is a hard no from me."

It starts as a very in your face summery floral (that kind of sting-y bright white floral) but i find it the way it dries down for me to be absolutely wonderful. Maybe its just my skin chemistry but the coconut and vanilla really come out after a bit and leaves you with a creamy tropical beach fragrance for hours and hours"

It was a wash off for me. I don't know what it is, in addition to the tripical notes there's a soapy chemical note that blasts, maybe the neroli. I would recommend Aerin Hibiscus palm instead, it has the same tropical flowers without the weird soapy smell. It continues to linger after I washed it off with soap, so if you like the smell, it has strong longevity."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/By-Kilian/Sunkissed-Goddess-90336.html,Sunkissed Goddess By Kilian perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Ok so I feel like this one isn’t getting any love. I smelled it in Sephora and wasn’t super wowed at first but figured I’d spray it on myself to give it a wear test. This does something really wonderful when it sits on your skin for a bit. My husband recommended we go back and get it so we did.Killian does an incredible job with florals. The floral notes here stay very true throughout the entire wear. The intention behind this fragrance was island vacation with the warmth of the sun pulling through the florals. There’s some vanilla and coconut in the base of SKG but it’s not what this is about, it’s very much a solar floral. If you are expecting a vanilla or coconut bomb this isn’t what you’re after. Those notes are subtly there and complimentary, not smacking you in the face. This really needs to be on skin to be appreciated. I personally think it’s a beautiful warm weather fragrance. Since I got it, I’ve been reaching for it constantly.Similar fragrance to Solei Blanc but without any blue or marine notes in SG. I definitely prefer this one to SB since the lasting power is much better than SB and SG has more depth."

On skin, it turned into a cloying coconut floral conditioner bomb. It’s a scrubber. Not worth $300.It’s like Kilian tried to push out a summer fragrance at the last minute and went with “OK this’ll do, let’s make it limited edition and hope we make some revenue” version."

It didn't feel like summer at all, I just smell an annoying, old man smell. Than turn around. I like the dry down, it reminds me of a shampoo I used a long time ago. I really smell ylang-ylang, not my favorite flower, but if you like it, try it, because it's nicely developed. I also didn't buy Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi in a large bottle because of the ylang-ylang. I have almost every perfume from The Narcotics series, but I won't buy this one. I don't feel any identity with Tom Ford, this Sunkissed Goddess is much more and more interesting than TF.However, if it matters to anyone, this perfume caused me heavy allergic itch as many pre-IFRA perfumes from decades ago due to the natural ingredients. The longevity is perfect, I can still feel it on the hair on my neck after 18 hours."

But I never blind by a $300 Killian so I've gone to Sephora several times now to test on my skin. I'm so disappointed at how ""perfumy"" and cheap this smells. I guess it smells a little fruity with the essence of monoi and cheap coconut, but it's straight up a designer fragrance that ""belongs"" on the shelf at Sephora. This is not tropical vacation in a bottle. It is not sexy like the name would suggest. Some people compare it to Soleil Blanc, but they are nothing alike."

Lots of tiare and coconut immediately jump out on my skin. Neroli is there but blended in pretty well giving it a clean feeling. No guaiac to me, but the drydown adds a creamy vanilla Not hyper realistic but doesn't smell overly synthetic either. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table and this has been done many times over. A solid choice if you're looking for something in this genre, but otherwise a ho hum release.

I have a travel size of TF Soleil Blanc, and it is definitely similar. You don’t need both if you have one. TF is more floral IMO whereas Sunkissed Goddess is warmer. I like both but prefer SKG.

This is everything I had hoped it would be and more! I honestly couldn’t be more impressed with this stunning gem! Sunkissed Goddess is truly incredible and so perfectly named! A luxurious tropical beach vacation bottled!☀️🌴🥥The Tiare Flower, Coconut, and Vanilla are the real stars here! They really give the impression of a stunning and luxurious monoi oil! The Tiare flower gives a softly sweet and delicately powdery unique white floral scent… it’s a very lovely note that I personally adore and definitely don’t see as often as I’d like especially in beachy/coconut fragrances! I'm extremely impressed with how prominent it is! The coconut is sweet and tropical, but not overwhelming. It blends so perfectly with the Tiare Flower to give it that exquisite and uniquely luxurious monoi oil scent! The delicately sweet, warm, and creamy Vanilla adds to the elegance of the monoi oil scent and overall beauty of this incredible fragrance! The bergamot, neroli, ylang-ylang, Labdanum, and Guaiac Wood add a really lovely and subtle freshness to the overall scent! I also notice a beautiful scent of the most luxurious and high end suntan lotion!Sunkissed Goddess reminds me a lot of NARS Monoi Body Glow and an old B&BW fragrance called Tiare Flower, both of which I have adored for years! I was never able to find anything similar until now, and this tops them both! This has already moved up into my all time top favorite fragrances! For reference, some of my favorite beachy fragrances include Tom Ford Soleil Blanc, Nest Sunkissed Hibiscus, Replica Beach Walk, Estee Lauder Bronze Goddess, JHAG Lust For Sun, and JHAG Vanilla Vibes! The performance of Sunkissed Goddess is absolutely exceptional! The longevity is crazy good, I can still easily smell this on myself the next day (I could probably even wear it that 2nd day without applying more if I skipped my shower!)! The projection is fantastic, it can be smelled from a few feet away! I only need 2 - 3 sprays to get this incredible performance! All of this amazing performance as well as the stunning scent itself make me feel that it's worth its price in my humble opinion (I feel that I should add that I don't often spend this kind of money on a single fragrance, but I just knew she would be THAT GIRL and I absolutely had to have her!)! I honestly could not recommend this more for lovers of beachy/coconut scents like myself! I'm already working on getting myself a second bottle of this because I'm already super hooked on it!"

It's creamy woody and spicey flower scent. Reminds me of nivea cream that would be lightly fragranced. Expected anything but this.

Yes, I do get some rich yet refreshing, warm and ripe fruits, like mango, pear. Ar the same time it is floral with added coconut. Amount of coconut is minimal, but I kept getting whiffs of it because this note I don't always enjoy and in here it reminds me of Holiday by Mancera and I'm not a fan. It is a nice summary scent though, just on the perfectly balanced line of being too generic and too unique. Good performance, only not my type."

Now was it worth the full retail price absolutely Not! I must say out of all of my kilian fragrances Which is a good 30 bottles this one is different after sniffing my wrist again it does remind me of Tom ford SOLEIL BLANC which I learned to love maybe this one will grow on me too! So the notes I got was coconut, a tiny bit of a woody note and the tiniest Bergamont so this so all coconut on me I wish vanilla was more prominent I can’t wait to mix it with Tom Ford vanilla Sax for bedtime 🥰 but I think it’s a safe blind buy for coconut lovers."

It could be the Guaiac wood I'm smelling but I don't know what that smells like exactly.) It's like...the brown hairy cracked coconut shells..... and then flowers. To my nose I smell substantial tiare flower .... But what it actually reminds me of is Hawaii (Oahu). I went there years ago and I remember smelling Hawaiian Gardenia & Plumeria *Everywhere*...this perfume just reminds me of those pretty flowers with the biggest fragrance throw...... that and Pina Colodas.....and sunsets....and Waikiki Beach.

Hopefully it is a real coconut tropical fragrance from Kilian. Keeping my eye out to try it. If I do like it, I would probably wait to get it as a present since it releases in the US in April which is perfect timing.Update: after being released in the US, it seems like it's less of a coconut-vanilla fragrance and more a beachy sweet tropical-floral, coconut-vanilla suntan oil. The florals are a pinch carnal and dense. I said l'd stick with Beach Walk but I'm debating. They both have their slight differences even with the florals. I sprayed Sunkissed Goddess on my skin in Sephora and it does have longevity, at least 6 hours, which it should for the price. I can see how it can be cloying in the heat for some. Since this is not a sweet coconut fruit scent and is more of a sun product scent, it will be hard to use outside the associated hotter weather. I think it's perfect for a tropical setting. It seems a lot of houses and people conflate coconut with sunscreen always, instead of the different ways the fruit can be done which is interesting."

I get that they're both solars, but it is immediately obvious that both are trying to do very different things.Sunkissed Goddess is very much a sweet, indulgent solar while Soleil Blanc is undoubtedly spicier and fresher. I would recommend this perfume to the gourmand girls who want a sweet and sunny perfume for the summer. This perfume has an intense suntan/sunscreen lotion oilness that I personally find delicious. The tiare is the star of this fragrance, and immediately reminded me of the NARS Monoi line (specifically their Monoi candle which was incredible but has now been discontinued).This perfume feels sensual in a ""lounge, flirt, and tan under the Hawaiian sun all day but never actually go into the water"" type of way. The oiliness that I mentioned earlier is definitely one of my favorite qualities in a solar fragrance and makes me wish this was an actual oil that I could slather all over my body for the summer. That, paired with the buttery and creaminess of the coconut makes this feel like a sweet treat. I do think the sweetness can be polarizing on different people's skin, so go test this out at Sephora before you drop $295 on this.The nearest comparison I can make to this perfume is Terracotta by Guerlain. They smell differently initially, but after 3-4 hours on the skin they both impart a very sensual warmth. I thought Aloha Tiare EDT by Comptoir Sud Pacifique might be comparable, but that one has a horrific dirtiness to it."

Summer in a bottle! If you’re familiar with Bobby Brown’s Beach perfume. This is something along the same lines, just a a lot more elegant and complex. Much better than Tom Ford’s Soleil Blanc, as others have mentioned.This is the NICHE version of your typical designer sunscreen, beachy, tiare flower, coconut summer scent.Kilian; please keep this limited edition perfume for us to enjoy for many years to come! :)"

It starts as a very in your face summery floral (that kind of sting-y bright white floral) but i find it the way it dries down for me to be absolutely wonderful.

It is like a very fresh and clean, laundry and soap kind of scent, but still very creamy and warm. Impressive creation. Upon initial application it projects like a beast for some 15 min then still performs very solid for the next few hours. Final dry down is a bit confusing, as I get something at the base... That reminds me of a waffle cone accord from some indie brand. Not sure I am a fan of that, but overall for the amazing scents bubble during the initial hours it is still worth it. That waffle cone might be due to vanilla and some other notes combines, and I'm sure without it this scent would loose it's character. Amazing, unique and easily recognisable scent, almost remind me of Amouage in that way."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"OK, I really wanted to love this. Mostly because it's a collab with acne studios and since many of their clothes are out of budget, I thought it would be cool to have the fragrance. That, coupled with the fact that I was looking for an in-between -awkward season-transitional fragrance, and I thought 'clean, powdery' fragrance would fit that bill. I loved the bottle, didn't properly test it or wear it enough. I impulse bought it and thought ""yes, good choice, cute bottle"". The second time I wore it I was in a mall and halfway I was in need of a sink to scrub it off with a generous bit of soap. This is an extremely cloying, artificial fruit candy, more specifically those banana hard candies. It literally smells the way those would taste. Mix that with an uber sweet peach body spray, add some downy (the concenratred kind) and this is the scent. At least what I got. Not cheap either. Sad and cloying experience"

So you have to find a local store that carries FM and try it on. I was really curious after the mixed reviews both here and on youtube. First impression- fabric softener- I felt like smelling like the blue fluffy rabbit featuring in the Lenor commercial. Now this was two hours ago and it is now very bubble gummy- violet sweat scent combined with peach. It is still very strong and lingering around. I am hoping for it to develop further as right now it is not on the luxury price tag level that it has and does not correspond to the rest of FM range."

Very good performer, but the scent is not very refined imo; it could have been a fluffy peach laundry detergent, but the sweetness and stickiness that develops overtime is not good to me unfortunately."

I was smelling different FM fragrances and Acne caught my eye. I smelled the bottle and I was intrigued - Smells floral-feminine I thought. But wait, does it...? Wait what...? What is this...? Got my decants of UNcut gem and L'eau d'hiver and went my way. But the smell of Acne kept haunting me.Went back the next day, sprayed it on my hand and went about my business. Opening was, as many mentionned, a blast of aldehydes, not the most enjoyable but interesting. Then after 1-2 hours, floral stage which I didn't care about. But then, after 3 hours or so, the most exquisite and addictive drydown of peach, vanilla, musk and incense.I went back to the store a couple times to spray again to be sure I was getting the same experience, lest time spraying on fabric also. And this time, the aldehydes clinged to the fabric the most which made it quite annoying after a while.I decided to buy a decant from someone on a Facebook group to test it further.From the decant, the three stages were not as distinct for whatever reason. Upon spraying, it's more of a linear mashup. I don't get the floral second stage as much and as distinctly. And the opening, when on fabric is similar to the smell of damp clothes from freshly washed hair - Which still becomes annoying after a while. But, the same heavenly drydown is there.So far, I'm torn between tolerating the aldehydes to experience the drydownReally not sure it's FB worthy as far as I'm concern considering the price tag"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Second time wearing this creative creation, and it is very different than any other mass pleasing new release. However I thought it will be one of them. I have already written a review before but I gave it another chance. AcneStudios is blended wonderfully and has three very different stages.At first it is an aldehyde bomb, as everyone already mentioned before me. you actually drowning in laundry detergent - if you love it you'll love it. One would think it will stay on this clean girl train but no. Second phase is a chaos. I can smell everything all at once, flowers, desserts, cleanliness, wood, flowers and musk maybe? This is the phase when the flowers are starting to appear on my skin.Third phase is when it finally dries down to be a creamy floral. Nobody mentioned but it reminds me to byKilian Good Girl Gone Bad Extreme - the flowers and the peach. Frankincense and heliotrope elevates it and thanks god it is not a new wave skin scent. I could live without the vanilla in this whole equation but I still enjoy smelling like this, pretty much. And that is the point I guess"

The quintessential aldehyde that boasters compliment after compliment from people who love and hate fragrances. What I mean is, people who love fragrances the way I do compliment me on this scent and the people who prefer much lighter and barely there scents also compliment me. It is super versatile, unique and lovely. I have well over 200 fragrances and my current signature is Blu Indaco, but I think this one may take the spot of #1 in my collection!!!The price is steep but the performance is excellent, so I really can't complain.

And gender aside, the fragrance is flat out addictive, and the precise calibration and balance of textures, and sheer strength, is remarkable. I keep wanting to reapply when hanging out at home.I ended up buying the “Pez fabric softener” after all. It is indeed addictive. BTW I notice the soapy fizz of the aldehydes even more when spraying from the bottle than from the small spray sample. Also, now that I’ve worn it a number of times, its distinct incense character has become very present and inseparable from the overall wearing experience."

The brand has taken a lot of stick since the release of Heaven Can Wait and Uncut Gem, but I think this one actually is quite nice.People have commented on the fact that it smells like detergent and they're not wrong. It does. However, it smells like a very expensive detergent and the performance and longevity is really good on me.Like most FM's performance is always pretty good, but this bellows out on me all day and I'm constantly getting whiffs throughout my working day.It's a strong aldehydic fragrance for sure, I can't pick out many individual notes. I did speak to an SA at FM and they told me it was a 'aldehydic Gourmand' which I can't really get behind personally, I don't pick up much peach.If you're a fan of soapy fragrances such as Prada Infusion d'homme and powdery scents you'll probably like this.

This review is a powdery-clean aldehyde scent with a light touch of the peach and light florals. There's a distinct soft, almost creamy, powdery, soapy scent I couldn't quite put my finger on until the sales paerson said it reminded them of the original Dove soap smell. That's it! Very aldehyde-y and clean, but not clean in a citrus fresh way, more like a calming, almost baby powder way.Acne Studios is for those who want that clean soapy scent. It's extremely mild, comforting, and powdery with a very light violet floral aspect. Acne Studios' reminds me specifically of an expensive cotton white t-shirt that was washed and dried with a very high-end detergent.Is it expensive? Yes.Is it great quality? Yes!If you like Blanche by Byredo, Muse by Zarkoperfume, or Borelli by Tiziana Terenzi, then this is by far the best of those freshly clean fragrances.When compared to the other fragrances listed above, Acne Studios is a very beast mode fragrance.

They're missing the ""steam"" quality here, and the diffuse, heatful aspect of it.You are *not* breathing in direct laundry detergent. You are at a warm, slightly steamy laundromat in the winter, chewing Fruit Stripe gum. When you reach into the dryer to take out your fuzzy sweaters and alpaca scarves, you can smell the faded fabric softener. The static gently zaps you. (Yes, you are laundering specifically fuzzy knitwear, not T-shirts or plain cotton. Also yes, I know you can't put alpaca in the dryer!). This is how Acne smells to me. I believe it will be a really nice perfume to wear in winter, since it conveys the pleasantly warm sensation of wearing laundered clothes fresh from the dryer. That ""clean"" aesthetic also makes this an easy reach for spring and lighter weather.I really like this one. I'm a big fan of Frederic Malle perfumes, but many can be intense, big thesis statements. Acne is extremely wearable everyday scent in the vein of Eau de Magnolia. It's definitely office safe. The longevity is impressive. Enjoy it without any guilt!"

If this scent sparks any storytelling in my mind -- to me, it has the feeling of being out in a park on a cool, sunny day, eating fresh peaches, wearing clean clothes still a bit warm from the dryer.It feels romantic but it's absurdly wearable, with equally absurd longevity, especially for this kind of fragrance. I've equally enjoyed wearing it out at night and during the day -- incredibly versatile, I agree with some other reviewers that it sort of blends seamlessly into your skin and your clothes to become another aspect of your 'uniform.' I don't think I've ever had this many compliments from a fragrance before, and I haven't had the chance to buy a full bottle (just went through two samples). But -- having said all this -- I think this fragrance does hugely depend on your personal skin chemistry also, maybe more so than typical fragrances (because of the aldehydes?).

Still a very lovely scent, would turn my head if I smelt this in public"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,A friking blast of Aldehyde followed by a DENSE concoction of Vanilla and Peach.I find it reminiscent to Coco (Aldehydic Peach)with characteristics of Oud Satin Mood’s style of Dense Vanillic Florals.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I think the reviewers here are being overly-critical.ACNE par FM is all about light, fizzy, aldehydic top-notes which eventually give way a soft, fruity, floral, skin-musk. The listed floral notes of damask rose, orange blossom, and violet are hard for my nose to pick up and peel back but they are definitely there alongside a ripe peach note. Overall, this is very fitting with the ACNE Studios / Copenhagen aesthetic which is young, pastel, light and airy."

The diffusion is amazing though. Headache. I never thought I would re-evaluate Heaven Can Wait. That was at least trying to be a perfume. This is just a cheap air freshener."

Warm powder musk meets cold fruity synthetic. While not exactly the same, I definitely feel like this is in the same vein as Hermes H24 & CDG 2. I think the biggest surprise was how loud this scent is, the projection is nuclear & this lasts ages. I really like this one, although at around $390 CAD it's undeniable this is very overpriced for what it is."

Because it is a great perfume, it smells on me 2 days straight.Absolutely not Frederic Malle vibe, but I love both classical Malle scents and this one.It is not boring, it is not cheap smelling. It is unique, it is also very “acne” — it suits the style of the brand.Unreal contemporary scent for those who want to smell modern, different, cool etc.Absolutely obsessed, it’s a yes for me. Yes, it is little bit soapy. It is floral scent, aldehydes. Not overwhelmingly powdery. Very scandi as well. This is how Copen-Stockholm stylish youth would smell like. Especially Copen people with colourful mismatched summer outfits.Spring-summer, daytime funny unique scent."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Polarizing reviews for this one I see but I’m really digging this one a lot. This is very youthful. To me it smells like soft peaches, violets and laundry detergent, a really luxurious high end one but it is what it is and I love it. It’s soapy and has a cozy uplifting musk. Aldehydes usually bother me but in here they don’t at all. It’s a compliment getter too as most clean and fresh fragrances tend to be. It seems like it’s going to be too much when you first spray but it settles in nicely and projects well in your bubble and leaves a nice sillage. The longevity was great, lasted half the day and I had a few girls in the gym locker room compliment and ask me about what I was wearing when I wore this. It’s overpriced for what it is but I enjoy it."

A very nicely done and well blended clean soapy/white musky fragrance. This would make a very good dumb reach, office friendly, or day time signature scent for someone who loves peach fragrances but wants something a bit cleaner and easier to reach for than most other syrupy sweet peach scents. It means ever so slightly feminine, but gender in perfume is silly. I can see this growing me on more, but the price tag is a bit much for my college budget…Very good performance with surprisingly good projection for the first half.8.3/10.

I do have experience and like to buy different scented laundry detergents + softeners and I am always interested in buying clothes refresher mists which are lovely on certain types of fabrics such as cashmere and cotton (I recommend falconeri cashmere clothes mists, they come in two scents and the vanilla is my favorite) however they are usually a fraction of the cost. The price reminds me of TF prices and if I had to choose between buying a TF fragrance or this, I’d choose TF. I do think this is a very interesting collaboration and that the specific perfumer who created this scent has a long successful career ahead of her!"

In short, you'll feel it all the time, giving rise to an elegant and vibrant fragrance that stands out but is never overpowering.Modern and chic, I really liked it.Oh and to get better into the concept watch a runway show by acne studios, a brand I literally adore, like Malle on the other hand.Great performances, very appropriate for warmer seasons."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Having in mind what olfactory type of scent this is it is actually pretty good. I get that connotation why this perfume smells like laundry detergent Acne Studios is an overall clothing brand so I pretty much I get the idea and kind of like the whole concept of this perfume.I am not sure about USA but in EU 90's there were these brands ARIEL and TIDE and they were the main brands for laundry detergents this is exactly that smell, strong, powerful, over-the-roof screechy but so nostalgic and it indeed smells like clean laundry. It is kind of nostalgic to me and I am quite fond of 'clean' scents so this is actually nice, I would definitely spray my clothing in the closet with this perfume to keep the freshly washed effect.If you like this kind of scent like Byredo Blanche, CdG - Marseille you should definitely try this, but it is actually potent so be careful not to overspray. 1-2 sprays are actually enough for the day or even the other day for a more settled and softer feeling. I might even think about spraying the clothes the day before wearing them to get the softer illusion of these freshly washed clothes.I think this is a perfect scent for a white t-shirt and jeans look, but the price tag... it's a bit too much for the perfume that it is."

Frederic Malle marketing department must be working overtime to clean up the Fragrantica page ahead of the launch. They did the same thing with Une Rose."

Low-key into this “eating ripe peaches beside fresh clean sheets drying in the summer sun” vibeThose saying it’s unbalanced or not well done, I’m not sure what you’re smelling. There are reasons to dislike this (aldehyde overdose etc) but this is without doubt a fine fragrance. A “clean” fragrance that isn’t generic, a sweet fragrance that smells like skin, floral yet not perfume-y - this collaboration maintains all of FM codes and offers an elegance to that easy reach, everyday clean girl/boy category.I get a lot of the fuzzy peach skin and cosy sandalwood which makes it a winner for me as I’ve not found anything that manages to read warm while performing in high heat, this does! It lasts too. Had it on a scent card and a friend brought it to his face the next day, his eyes rolled back and he asked “what is this?”Hell I might have convinced myself to get a full bottle while writing this review, shame about that price tag"

Dry down smells like old carpet.I think if you go based off smelling this in a store and not experiencing it on your skin & outdoors, you might like it, but please sample because it definitely changes.I wish it stayed a full on detergent ( that’s what I got in store and fell in love with, but I got a very different experience while using the sample for a few days ).

I must be challenged by aldehydes, as I have a response to them that is both intrigued and mildly repulsed at the same time. Yet, I love clean scents— although most feel generic. This scent is clean and unforgettable. It starts a bit much for me (thank you aldehydes) and ends so beautifully sweet and clean. It evolves. It is a true and well-formulated scent with dimensions.Sometimes you just have to go beyond your bounds. Beyond your initial… oh my… “no way” … to allow yourself to step into new and well curated, well done territory. This is that territory."

A really nice laundry detergent. That's it.Yes, if you keep sniffing you can detect some hidden notes somewhere in there, but it's still a rather linear, pleasant fragrance. As if you just put on newly washed clothes. It's very wearable, but for the price, it's underwhelming. It feels more like a hyped-up collaboration, rather than a fragrance that stands on its' own two legs. Nothing wrong with it, but also nothing exceptional or intriguing.

It’s the definition of functional product formula. It’s familiar, good, to market this as a fine fragrance formula is a daring act, especially given the price of 340 euros for 100ml. I think it’s crazy, but this is luxury fashion for you. Also the scent itself will surely have their fanatics, such as my girlfriend, it was an instant eye opening wow for her. For me, I look at from a perfumery point of view and can’t justify the price. But then again, there aren’t many options if you are someone who always wished for that Ariel washing pod’s or fabric softener or house cleaning agent smell as a perfume to smell like you’re always wearing clothes right after wash.Oh and it’s super potent…at least on paper it seems to last forever, again no surprise given the functional product formula origin, which are constructed to last washing cycles for days, weeks on clothes…And final note: Aldehyde is not one note or scent profile, it's a chemical group and spreading like a misinformation virus online, evident from some reviews. The aldehydes used here are the floral ones, mainly the ones used to achieve lily of the valley (muguet) and cyclamen type airy floral notes what otherwise wouldn't be possible to achieve in perfumery. The aldehydes profile here has absolutely no relation to the fatty (aliphatic) aldehydes where most people know from Chanel No.5. (Not to say Acne Studios doesn't have any of fatty aldehydes, but the main scent profile is based on the cyclamen and muguet ones, just like in Byredo Blanche, Fleur de Peau etc.) in combination with ionones (violet) and jasmine (probably hedione, benzyl acetate), also provides the base accord of Nivea cream and many more household and cosmetic products."

Their pink-peach color is very suitable for this perfume.It is making the housekeeper into the main character. A smell of work for the rich who never clean themselves, who buy brand new Acne sneakers designed with fake dirt on them, because even dirt is something they prefer to have under control.It is an interesting perfume which can be smelled like a comment on the perfume industry and the stories it tells us, as well as a commentary on both Frederic Malle under the control of a conglomerate and Acne Studios themselves, and their aesthetics.It smells sweet, clean, presumably simple, but there is a lot of thought behind it.I enjoy it more the more I use it."

The aldehydes are not sharp, but very well-balanced and ~warm~. I noticed that some of the reviews mentioned warmth. This is a soft laundry smell of a fluffy towel just out of a dryer, something you want to hug, put it closer to your face to inhale and embrace the feeling of HOME.I don't personally feel any Chanel vibes in that (some mentioned 22 and N5, which are way sharper imho), but the closest I would say is Le Labo's city exclusive Aldehydes. Mind you, that Le Labo is at least 30% more expensive (but also good and has more of N5 DNA).Acne collab is a truly unique scent. Yet, Frederic Malle hasn't been very recognized in their ordinary style with this release, but having a thinking of outside the box is that what drives a progress. No need to stall even in perfumery."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"My first impression of the perfume was immediately 'bubblegum!'. There's a synthetic note in 'Acne Studios', which is merged with this natural kind of violety powdery sensation through the lens of this synthetic note. I imagined myself opening a pack of 'Hubba Bubba' chewing gum, and softly biting through this powdery, elastic layer. The perfume contains as well white musk, causing this ticklish sensation, together with the aldehydes (to my nose atleast), making it project and last for a pretty long time.On the website of 'Acne Studios', the perfume is described as neoclassical and containing different oppositions. So I guess Frederic Malle tries to merge this classical-powdery-soapy part with an synthetic-cold edge. Suzy le Helley describes her own creation on an instagram post, as a cozy scarf that envelops the wearer.Reading on the oppositions like described by Frederic Malle, I imagine myself as the protagonist in a Sofia Coppola movie, having this soft magnetic charm from a distance, so ever fascinating the surrounding, as long as the surrounding is kept at a distance. The bubble has to eventually pop, whenever the wearer is approached by an antagonist. The perfume seems then a loud proclamation of tender softness from a distance, becoming louder and screechier from upclose.For anyone writing in the comments negatively on the soapy quality in Acne Studios: there's nothing wrong with a soapy perfume."

Maurice Roucel created Uncut Gem ... which I wear most days, I find the effect to be very similar to Acne. . the price point is very high... it's worth it IMO. great collaboration, FM, Suzy and Acne. can't wait to see what Suzy Le Helley doesnext... 10/10"

All that PR release ‚conceptual’ drivel is not able to conceal the fact that it is a cash-grab based on hype. Can’t really imagine Frederic Malle being proud of this release and wonder why he very recently left his brand. I am afraid new management will cheapen and eventually kill what has been a great brand dedicated to perfumery as art. While laundry detergent might in fact be a ‚pleasantly inoffensive’ scent as other reviewers try to ‚praise’ it, I simply cannot fathom how this ‚pleasant’ and ‚inoffensive’ laundry detergent could be placed on the same shelf alongside Portrait of a Lady, Musc Ravageur or En Passant. That’s some very dark humour from the brand that once was founded on artistry. It’s an olfactory equivalent of Balenciaga - mix of pedestrian quality, milking pop trends with hefty price tag and online hype."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I really like this. The aldehydes jump out immediately with a piercing, almost sour brightness that reminds me of hot steam. Immediately I think ""laundry soap"" but this is an embellished, fantasy-like vision of that. I'm not that familiar with a lot of soft, aldehydic women's perfumes from the likes of Chanel (probably more similarities there), but it reminds me a bit of Heeley's Cardinal with it's sharp aldehyde opening and clean linen accord. Here the effect is better and even more nose-tingling, modern, and comforting. It's like putting a wool scarf up to your nostrils and feeling the warm, freshly laundered fabric hit your nose. The effect has a texture to it that feels fuzzy, radiant, and slightly mineralic with a fruity undertone. The incense is doing a lot here, and I pick up a subtle, natural smoky quality hidden inside. It's somewhat nostalgic like the embrace of a well-worn piece of clothing that's never seen dirt. Both cozy but summer-appropriate as it feels like the sun is breathing warmth into a set of linens hung out to dry. That hyper-focus and elevation of something rather mundane is Frederic Malle showing his skill. The brief may be a bit lackluster but the execution is excellent. I don't think anyone has ever smelled laundry like this, and writing off the experience as such is a bit reductive. The peach note is blended very well and the stained glass bottle gives a very good nod to the personality of this perfume. It reminds me of the peach in Heaven Can Wait but less forward, and I like this more for it's luminescent, fresh, and floral quality. I do end up connecting this to simpler things I've smelled at various points in my life, but this is an intense, surrealist perspective that touches a lot of emotional centers in my brain. Unfortunatley I hate limited editions and can't imagine spending what they're asking for it at the moment. Otherwise a great addition to the set of collaborations Malle has done."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"Writing stream-of-consciousness:Opening blast highly reminiscent of the aldehydes employed in Minneapolis 5.3 by Spyros Drosopoulous. This, however, quickly calms down and transitions into a metallic, almost grape / blackberry like accord, further smoothed out by an underlying violet. People are referencing the salmon pink at the bottom of the bottle; however, I see almost more fuchsia as opposed to magenta. This is a bit more transparent than 5.3, but this does indisputably reference detergent/fabric softener. This is metallic, tongue tickling aldehydes that verge on the tuning-fork-to-the-skull effect, but really calm themselves down to a background presence within a reasonable amount of time - the persistence of the effervescence seems quite astonishing and is quite enjoyable (the same sort of happy feeling I get with Cristalle Eau Verte) - personal preference may vary.The overall fragrance now 20 or so minutes in wears relatively moist, as opposed to say the chalky dry down of No 5 L’eau. Unlike L’eau though, this is not aggravating my sinuses regardless of me placing my nose close to the skin or retaining distance from my arm. The detergent association is inescapable, but this is not dusty - quite fresh, uplifting, and less (imo) crass compared to the more recent MFKs.This smells “icy” without being “cold”. Hence I believe the references to No. 22. Perhaps a bit of bubblegum too - that pink rose bubblegum feeling that FilipMurray references below reminding us of CDG Concrete - nothing too juvenile. My wife commented on a slight smokiness in the background, in our opinion attributed to the frankincense - that sort of cool, smoky, grey feeling to it. There is no watermelon in this, but I do get that sort of proto-aquatic fruity/salty freshness in the dry down akin to Aramis’ New West for Him (vintage, not that abomination Gentleman’s Collection version).The fragrance is perhaps traveling down a linear path, but there are a few swerves here and there - the fragrance feels fluid instead of static. It retains interest - I keep wanting to discern the scent subtleties. The deep dry-down brining incensed sandalwood rubbed over with a vanilla balm - not sweet, not different, just a continual smoothing of the opening.This reminds me more of the quality/pace of the brand with Eau De Magnolia, say as opposed to earlier produced Iris Poudre - make of that what you will.This makes me happy.Owning Lys Mediteranee (my wedding fragrance and first Malle), Bois d’Orage, Geranium Pour Monsieur, Vetiver Extraordinaire, Cologne Indelibe, and Eau De Magnolia, I can genuinely see myself reaching for my wallet for this far sooner than for either Rose & Cuir or Heaven Can Wait.I think a lot of the contempt for this fragrance is due to Malle retiring and this being a collaboration that “appears” more low-browed compared to Dries Van Noten and Alber Elbaz - I believe wholeheartedly if this had a black label marked with Suzy Le Helley’s name and was given a conventional title (let’s randomly steal “Tigerlily” from Natalie Merchant’s debut solo album) this would be less attacked and more appreciated for what it is.In fact, it’s a crime that Suzy doesn’t get her name plastered on this - just as Bruno for Dries and Dominique for Superstitious . For her first all-on-her own fragrance? Bravo!"

It's airy, long-lasting, and has excellent projection.Aldehydes, musk, peach, orange blossom, sandalwood, and a hint of frankincense. Like the most beautiful and potent fabric softener. Sounds simple - but it's not.It partly reminds me of Superstitious because of the aldehydes, but they are still completely different. Acne Studios is not sour, it's much easier to wear... The drydown reminds me of CDG - Concrete, probably because of the sandalwood...Perfection!After the sad news that Frederic is leaving the brand - I can say that he left EDPFM with style. I already see this one in my top 10."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I am so sad. I LOVE FM scents. I love ACNE. This is gross. And that surprises me because if you look at the scents that I own, this should be right up my alley, and it's not. I was reading other reviews and excited to receive the samples. But nope.The dry down is beyond sickly sweet on me. I know they were targeting a younger audience (which is very much apparent by how it smells), but I am used to FM scents being refined and elegant. This just reminds me of a young girl's first foray into perfume and buying something overwhelming and crass like Clinique Happy or Juicy Couture (I'm not saying it smells like those, but you know the types of perfumes I am talking about). This smells like it belongs on the shelf of a drug store with a low price point. That's how cheap it smells.I rarely, if ever, leave reviews on here, but that's how strongly I feel against this perfume and it being in the FM lineup. That's not to say FM has to keep it safe by any measure - but this is so beneath what I would expect from them. Major bummer."

It is nothing edgy, cool, forward thinking or Scandinavian as you would expect. It smells like pure and strong floral fabric softener - hate it or love it. But the longevity is very impressive and the scent on my skin after 12 hours is really nice and a little addictive. It's definitely not groundbreaking - it's not complex and smells like a cheaper perfume brand, but the quality of scent tells a different story."

It's clean, soapy, a little sweet, pretty, and light with a moderate sillage. It's BDK Pas Ce Soir's Nordic cousin. This perfume is unisex but I find it to be more flowery feminine. This is a nice Spring sent – nothing groundbreaking but super wearable. Too expensive for what it offers for my needs but worth testing at least."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"When you have made as many serious perfumes as Frederic Malle has, It's easy to understand why they have decided to make a less serious scent with this collab with such a modern and relevant brand as Acne Studios. A move like this is more expected of Byredo and I have to say...I am not mad. As a brand it's important to evolve and offer on ramps to people who aren't your typical client.Frederic Malle doesn't make playful or fun perfumes. Until now...Some will be annoyed at this, but it's just one release. Other releases will come after this that may suit your refined pallette better, but Acne Studios by Frederic Malle is a great example of a modern Aldehydic perfume done well. It's done so well that not one review, so far, describes this very aldehydic scent as smelling ""old school"", ""classic"" or ""granny-ish""...Aldehyde is typically dressed up and classic smelling but this is dressed down and modern. The fragrance nerd in me appreciates this and I don't see it as simple or basic at all. It's actually very complex and interesting for a playful scent and it pushes off skin very well for a perfume with a clean scent profile. As a man I also found this wearable even if it leans a little pretty at first. Clean is what we should all strive to be.A simple response to comments that bugged me out...-Yes its synthetic...Aldehydes and white musk aren't found in nature...smh...thats not a knock as u think it is-Yes it's clean...But it's lazy to describe it as laundry detergent. I've never smelled a detergent that smells like this. It's more like an expensive bar soap.-This scent will react differently depending on the wearers skin chemistry. Some will notice various stages and others will have a more linear experience. You are both right.-You can't make people happy anymore. If u make art that you can wear, no one buys it. If u make wearable perfumes with quality ingredients, people call it basic. It is what it is...I rate perfumes using the PAGE system...P- Poor A- Average G- Good and E for exceptional.This is a G imo when all things are considered and a very strong release for a brand that needed to evolve. This is far better than the releases before it, Uncut Gem and Heaven Can Wait because those perfumes annoyed Malle cult members and didn't attract new clients to the brand. At least Acne Studios will bring a whole new client to the Frederic Malle brand, even if it annoys the loyalists, and that's huge for them. Be mad but if you love FM, and want to see them be successful, they can't remain serious with every release and have to enroll new people to the line. This does that and then some. I'm curious to see what's next.YOUTUBE- SIMPLY PUT SCENTS"

In clean, crisp air, the orange blossoms are crystalline and frosty, while the musk and vanilla are chilled and elegant. Cold air keeps everything in its corner yet they all work in harmony.In warmer weather (we have hot and cold weather in San Francisco daily), the vanilla is amped, the musk is synthetic, and the orange blossoms become candy-sweet, giving me the impression of a melting orange creamsicle or a (rather inexpensive) scented candle.Sadly, I get no notes other than orange, musk, and vanilla. My husband says it smells like a little girl's perfume, of the kind that comes with the purchase of a doll, regardless of the weather.It's not the Frederic Malle of yore (PoaL, MR, Noir Epices, etc.) and probably not a safe blind buy for FM diehards like myself. However, if you're a 14-year-old girl with disposable income, go for it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I am a long-time fan of Frédéric Malle, but their perfumes are not created equal. In addition, the quality of some of their older scents has diminished over time since the brand was acquired by Estée Lauder, but that's beside the point. Acne Studios par FM follows the trajectory of the now-discontinued Dries Van Noten par FM as a collaboration between this brand and a fashion house. Dries was one of the nicest modern sandalwoods. Acne Studios, in contrast, is a disappointment.AS is a bright, aldehydic scent. Like Estée Lauder White Linen or Chanel No. 22, the aldehydes are present from initial spray, blindingly white and squeaky clean. The florals are soapy and synthetic with some peachy sweetness, thanks to the orange blossom and peach notes. As a result, I have to agree with the common gripe regarding this scent - it very much resembles fabric conditioner. Clean white musk softens it somewhat, becoming more evident as it develops.It takes a long time for the aldehydic florals to subside, but the drydown is slightly powdery with some vanilla and violet adding subtle sweetness. This is my favourite phase of this scent, but it is nothing special. It fades to a sweet musky skin scent. Sillage is moderate and longevity is long-lasting. It is feminine-leaning, and is a spring/summer day scent, given its bright freshness.A pleasant but linear scent that leans heavily on its aldehyde note, AS is significantly overpriced for what it is. It is clean and minimal, in keeping with the Scandi aesthetic, and likely pandering to the TikTok ""clean girl beauty"" trend. However, it could have been much more interesting. Buy the aforementioned No. 22 instead if you seek expensive aldehydes. 2/5."

There is definable soap and big white floral in abundance big time, with a sweet edge.If you love white florals and aldehydes, yes, then you may love it.Is it tuberose? Is it orange blossom? something is not for me which is disappointing but it is excellent. Try it.I got the two sample vials and this is first spray. I need to wear it again and reflect. On first wear it’s big but clean/fresh floral.On my partner the frankincense and aldehydes persist. On me it ends up a tuberose/orange blossom heavy floral with a trace of linen. Tuberose isn’t even in the notes but I get it.Very different per wearer then. On me it’s Do Son like at the very end of dry down. It’s been a ride. Longevity is good, projection is mid.

Almost nostalgic. Think ""childhood soap"". Rose, abit of obscure florals with musc and depth from woods. Now what ruins this perfume is the aldehyde fruit note that screeches and screams. Its so sharp and off putting and unbearable. If i had to compare it, its a screaming childThrowing a complete fit of a meltdown while your trying to sleep at night after a brilliant bath.

The tshirt was washed in a fruity musky scented fabric softener, which by mistake was overdosed, was not washed of correctly and hadn’t dried well…a ripe musky fruity scent.While I generally love the scent of fabric softeners, this is a perfume that I wouldn’t like to carry not only on my skin but neither on my clothes…"

I don't enjoy Chanel No 5 much, but this somehow bolder and unapologeticly soapy fragrance is so god damn pleasant. It lasts and lasts too.. Also it has that perkaboo effect familiar from Baccarat Rouge, but much stronger. Where you get an unbelievably pleasant waft of soap and frankincense just popping in now and again.

The first being Chanel No.22, especially upon first spray. The aldehydes here are pretty intense, fatty and soapy. There is also a candied fruity accord that becomes a little more prominent once the aldehydes have settled - at this stage, the scent reminds me a little bit of Kirke by Tiziana Terrenzi. I also detect orange blossom during the drydown.Jonny Johansson, the creative director, compared the composition to laundry detergent and I have to agree. It's clean, powdery, sterile and little austere upon first spray. However, the fruits and florals warm up the scent as it develops.I'm excited to sample this scent on skin upon release. Those who enjoy powdery-aldehydic scents, such as Pikovaya Dama, No. 22, Aldehyde 44, are most likely going to embrace this offering!"

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I hope the scent is better than the clothing - Acne makes clothing that has a hipster streetwear drabness I find unimaginative and depressing. Then again, I can't see paying $1200 for ugly balloon pants. To each his own. No matter how good this smells, it is hard to get past the name. I still want to try it...but....Frederic Malle seems to have lost inspiration the last few years. IMHO. On the other hand, algebraist's description of it as being between No. 22 and White Linen sounds HEAVENLY. I adore aldehydes. Definitely on my try list now."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I smelt a lab vial a few days ago, and skin tested. It will be released 17th April for the UK market at least.I found it lying between N°22 and White Linen. There is that aldehydic and laundry aspect, with a somewhat vanillic, ambery sweetness and most notably more of a fruity facet than either reference. It is more vintage in its aldehydic profile than say, Aldehyde 44 from Le Labo which mostly relies on C12 MNA. I found that it actually evoked a baby pink not too dissimilar from the packaging of the bottle.I could not assess diffusivity but it was a tenacious formulation on skin. It doesn't push boundaries but is certainly off trend and matches the brand, so I commend it for that."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I think the reviewers here are being overly-critical.ACNE par FM is all about light, fizzy, aldehydic top-notes which eventually give way a soft, fruity, floral, skin-musk. The listed floral notes of damask rose, orange blossom, and violet are hard for my nose to pick up and peel back but they are definitely there alongside a ripe peach note. Overall, this is very fitting with the ACNE Studios / Copenhagen aesthetic which is young, pastel, light and airy."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"An easy favourite fragrance. If this scent sparks any storytelling in my mind -- to me, it has the feeling of being out in a park on a cool, sunny day, eating fresh peaches, wearing clean clothes still a bit warm from the dryer.It feels romantic but it's absurdly wearable, with equally absurd longevity, especially for this kind of fragrance. I've equally enjoyed wearing it out at night and during the day -- incredibly versatile, I agree with some other reviewers that it sort of blends seamlessly into your skin and your clothes to become another aspect of your 'uniform.' I don't think I've ever had this many compliments from a fragrance before, and I haven't had the chance to buy a full bottle (just went through two samples). But -- having said all this -- I think this fragrance does hugely depend on your personal skin chemistry also, maybe more so than typical fragrances (because of the aldehydes?). The dry-down seems to smell a bit differently on everyone.10/10Dream scent"

What’s better than going for an evening walk and suddenly being hit by the comforting smell of fresh laundry from the ventilation of someone’s laundry room?Acne Studios par Frederic Malle is indeed, as someone else here so eloquently said, the embellished fantasy laundry detergent with all the memories and emotions that goes with it and from what I know there is no other perfume like this out there. Really nice. A bit pricey, but really nice."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I've worn it a few times now and find that, surprisingly, I prefer it in cold weather versus warm, sunny days. In clean, crisp air, the orange blossoms are crystalline and frosty, while the musk and vanilla are chilled and elegant. Cold air keeps everything in its corner yet they all work in harmony.In warmer weather (we have hot and cold weather in San Francisco daily), the vanilla is amped, the musk is synthetic, and the orange blossoms become candy-sweet, giving me the impression of a melting orange creamsicle or a (rather inexpensive) scented candle.Sadly, I get no notes other than orange, musk, and vanilla. My husband says it smells like a little girl's perfume, of the kind that comes with the purchase of a doll, regardless of the weather.It's not the Frederic Malle of yore (PoaL, MR, Noir Epices, etc.) and probably not a safe blind buy for FM diehards like myself. However, if you're a 14-year-old girl with disposable income, go for it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,"I am so sad. I LOVE FM scents. I love ACNE. This is gross. And that surprises me because if you look at the scents that I own, this should be right up my alley, and it's not. I was reading other reviews and excited to receive the samples. But nope.The dry down is beyond sickly sweet on me. I know they were targeting a younger audience (which is very much apparent by how it smells), but I am used to FM scents being refined and elegant. This just reminds me of a young girl's first foray into perfume and buying something overwhelming and crass like Clinique Happy or Juicy Couture (I'm not saying it smells like those, but you know the types of perfumes I am talking about). This smells like it belongs on the shelf of a drug store with a low price point. That's how cheap it smells.I rarely, if ever, leave reviews on here, but that's how strongly I feel against this perfume and it being in the FM lineup. That's not to say FM has to keep it safe by any measure - but this is so beneath what I would expect from them. Major bummer."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Cleaning detergent that costs at least 300 dollars it’s as delusional as the sticker trick they imprinted under the bottle so the fragrance juice looks pinkAnd collaborating with one of the least experienced perfumers in the market with the excuse of great potential in the futureI wonder what potential ?doing boss bottled flankers !With all due respect to Mr.Malle but his brand is officially deadI recommend to buy as much as you can of what was created at his time after a couple of years this brand will be the next creed and the fragrances from the early 2010’s will cost a fortune just like the first batches of aventues nowadaysMark my words…..
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Frederic-Malle/Acne-Studios-91209.html,Acne Studios Frederic Malle perfume - a new fragrance for women and men 2024,Massive aldehydes and violet blast in the opening what makes it way too mature however after the first hour or two it’s completely gone and dries down into this barely noticeable girly skin scent what lasts more or less all day long. I really wanted to love this perfume as I like the aesthetic of Acne Studios but this is a let down from Frederic Malle and definitely not worth the £290 price tag.
