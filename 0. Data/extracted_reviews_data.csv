https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Love how subjective fragrances are. This is extremely hyped and if you love it, do enjoy it!I owned a 200ml bottle of this and Code Parfum at the same time. To my nose, it was redundant owning both as they are too similar in scent profile. I ended up selling my LMLP since the opening had something very off-putting to me, literally could not stand it. It's very synthetic and not as well blended as Code Parfum imho, but I also prefer the freshness in Code. I got compliments every time I wore this but I did not enjoy it on me.Dubbed a ""perfect date night scent"" to some reviewers, but I personally gravitate towards something more intimate. Again, if you love it and you can get passed that strong opening, enjoy it. LMLP is definitely the most mature out of the line, sexy, alluring and pretty versatile. Just not for me."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Mentioning anything outside of amber, vanilla, powdery iris is misleading, making me think you have never smelled this. Bitter cardamom? Buddy, there's a faint smell of card. This isn't a ""woah dude smell that cardamom, what's for dinner curry?"" Scent lmfao it's vanilla, powdery, VERY faint iris lavender. Lmao you imaginary smellers are worse then TIKTOK kids."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"The most mature of the Le Male line so as a more mature guy I really appreciate this one. Love the combination of cardamon, sweetness and the little bit of powder from the iris. It feels classic and modern at the same time. Doesn't project loudly but does last quite a long time. I think this is a great fall and winter fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,Não tem oque falar uma lavanda muito gostosaum cheiro masculino formal boa performance mais o melhor de tudo a fixação ficou na minha pele por 2 dias inteiros e ainda tem um bom cheiro de lavanda
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Cardamom, iris and vanilla with some woods and lavender mixed together to create this masterpiece of a scent. It is dark, sweet and still masculine with no synthetic notes or anything offensive, 12 hours of longevity with great projection on my skin. Mysterious and sexy, I would describe this one and in my opinion much better than Le Male Elixir and other Le Male fragrances but keep in mind that it won't worth the hype it gets. It's much more used than a sauvage, people will throw a shit on sauvage because it is so ''npc'' will buy this, overspray this and will just annoy you. If you want the best JPG fragrance in my opinion, you should check the ''other'' winter Le Parfum from JPG instead of this one. That being said, still great and still a masterpiece. Don't fall into the JPG meatrider hype and be dissapointed if you want to purchase this one."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I will be very real this fragrance is overhyped open youtube ""buy le male"" open Instagram ""le male is the sexiest"" every person like to hype this fragrance only because it's Jean Paul Gaultier's don't be fooled like I've been.The smell: first impression I got smelling this is "" I could have gotten better"" nothing safe blind buy in this, imagine this with me: you get hit at first with large dose of bitter cardamom then backed up with sweet lavender and iris and little vanilla I mean really cardamom - lavender - iris. This smells like an old grandpa no offense and cardamom making it very oriental. Really don't like that, it is sweet it is manly but in an old kind of way and people way to describe this is "" sofistcated"" are you kidding meDrydown is much better much smoother but no body can smell it even you unless you stick your nose to your bodyOver all: I can see people wearing this fragrance OK but it does not deserve to be hyped I am not saying it's the worst thing thing I've smelled. You smell it your self and you will know that you can get better. Don't blind buyEdit : I gave the scent time the aggressiveness feeling began to fade a little and the scent became more appealing and acceptable and sophisticated from a 5.5 to a 7.5 But still very over hyped in my opinion wouldn't choose it from my other frags in fact I like my Paco raban invictus victory way more than this it's ambery, dark and has vanilla close notes and sexier."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,Amazing fragrance and it was my first. Found this on TikTok and never looked back after buying it. It has a nice vanilla smell which isn't as musky as other fragrances or as heavy. I like the kind of light vanilla and lavender scent you get from it. A definite 9/10 for me and definitely a safe blind buy.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Because of it's weak sillage, it's easy to underspray, but still it retains so much boldness and character. I personally bought myself a 200ml bottle of this and it has become my signature wear. It has decent longevity and is one of the best designer iris that you can find. Comparing to other popular iris fragrances such as Dior Homme, it stands out with its cardamom note, giving it a warm spicy type of feel."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"smells like a designer masculine version of gris charnel by bdk. Gris charnel is still more enjoyable for me, but anyway le male le parfum is decent choice"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Got this as a gift from my grandmother after my brother requested it for himself, wow, simply incredible, I can see why the hype has climbed up in recent months.You get hit with overwhelming spice and cardamom from the get-go, strong as hell, but very enjoyable, don't overspray, because this is sure to get someone a headache. But then it mellows out, the more softer, weaker scents shine, Lavender especially, a woody scent through and through, not getting too much vanilla, but definitely there. If you can afford it, a very safe buy, everybody loves this one. 10/10 a great one for occasions and special outings."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,I don't really get the JPG hype other than with this fragrance. This would be really good for the colder days and I do enjoy how dark and refined this is however if I had this I don't see myself reaching for this over my other fragrances. Really nice and to me it's the best out of the JPG line.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Turns out the store where I tried this at twice probably had a faulty tester. Or a tester that got destroyed by heat. I got a sample directly from JPG and this was a completely different experience. The first tester lasted barely 6 hours on skin with very weak projection. The one from JPG lasts 24 hours and is very potent.I like it, it's very oriental and vanilla forward. I do prefer the Élixir though."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Sillage is kinda weak, so if you get this, get the 200ml bottle, because you're gonna need 8 sprays to get decent projection.As far as the scent goes, it's great. The best JPG projector so far is Ultra Male, but that's the blast of super sweet Ethyl Maltol, which is a powder in solid form. It smells like burnt sugar in powder form. Ethyl Maltol is also commonly used in vaping juices. Once the vehicle liquid evaporates, (the alcohol) you have a fine powdery residue that flakes off into the air and drives the sweetness. Iris works similarly, but it's not as intense and more floral than sweet. Iris is one of the main ingredients in many lipsticks, so that's why people tend to associate it with lipstick. Orris is more buttery and smooth. There is no Iris blast in this like in Dior Homme Intense. DHI is the quintessential Iris fragrance everyone goes to. Le Male Le Parfum is pretty well blended and every note seems to have its place. Not too sweet with the Vanillin, not too floral with the Lavender. Doesn't smell like Lavender much at all really. The Cardamom and Oriental notes (also referred to as spicy amber accord) add a great depth. The Cardamom note they created is necessarily reminiscent of the YSL masterpiece La Nuit De L'homme.Absolute love for this fragrance from me. 8.8/10. Would be a 10 if it projected better."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I've worn the same fragrance for 25 years since college & I'm just getting into wearing more fragrances. Based on YouTube reviewers, I bought decants and samples of 17 different designer and niche fragrances to see what was most attractive to my wife. I'm trying a mix of all scents, from fresh and citrusy, to sweet and gourmand, to spicy and mature.So far, I've tried Paco Rabanne Invictus Victory, Y edp from YSL, Azzaro The most wanted, Absolute from Scentologia, and Le Male Le Parfum and my wife said Le Male Le Parfum is her panty dropper favorite for sure, 9 of 10. We'll see if she feels the same way after trying the others. My next 2 will be Givenchy Gentleman Reserve Privee and Versace Dylan Blue. I'm 48, she's 44.If it helps, she rated Y edp & The Most Wanted a 7 and Absolute & Invictus Victory an 8. She said these were all good, but Le Male Le Parfum is the fave. Hope this helps anyone getting into fragrances like I am."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Its perfect everyday fall/winter fregfence, really warm smooth and coazy but modern and fresh at the same time, opening is identical to og le male but in like 10 minutes it becomes warm scpicy vanilla scent. I like it cuz it dosent stand out like elixir but is difrent enought to get complements. Last from 7-9 hours and projects really good, but for that price there are better fregrences7/10Was cooler in 2022"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Very cardamom heavy opening which personaly I really enjoy, The mid is where this breaks for me as I get a very spicy powderiness with almost nothing else going on. The dry down is mostly vanilla with soft hints of spiciness. Nice fragrance overall but I got bored of it quickly"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I just can't bring myself to like it a great deal. I don't know what it is, it just doesn't smell very good to me and makes no sense as such a great man's scent. I ESPECIALLY can't fathom the current rating for this. 4.60??? Really? Almost 15,000 votes?? How on earth can that be? Someone must be boosting this, because this juice is just downright too weird to have such universal acclaim. It's alright, sure, well-blended and so forth, but what is the huge appeal? It is unique for sure, no doubts there. I can't think of anything that smells anything like this except Elixir, but I need to get that and try it more. I've only tested it in store with a burnt nose. Le Parfum smells very linear and consistent to me throughout its dry down. I hear a lot of praise to the dry down, but to me it just gets slightly less pleasant. I'd rather wear Moustache EDP than this for a mature man. At least that overall smell makes sense, and the dry down is nice. I struggle to think of a situation where this would really rock, too. It's too weird for the day/work, and there are SO many better choices for night/going out. I had several big bottles, hoping I'd come around and trust that my nose needed education, but it's been too long. I sold all but 1, and I'm huffing it right now trying like crazy to see the angle. I've been doing the fragrance thing for years now, and I normally agree with the general assessment of this community's consensus about most things, but this is one of the biggest departures I've ever seen. This is either manufactured hype or a classic case study in the subjectivity of fragrance. I recommend CH Men for anyone looking for a semi-sweet manly scent. It doesn't perform amazingly, but just use more of it. Boom. It's not that expensive, and reformulation talk is crazy overblown. I own batches from 2010, 2012, and current and they are all identical. Random note, but I'm trying to contribute and that is my best advice."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"In the opening I get a burst of cardamom, very earthy to me and almost smelling like fresh cut lawn. Grassy vanilla. Maybe its just my nose. Its somehow off-putting yet alluring at the same time. It dries into a more pleasant, creamy vanilla that isn't too sweet, with soft lavender. I don't pick up any iris or powder. I actually wish it was a bit powdery.It smells better in the air, a ""dark"" sort of spiced vanilla. I'll continue to wear my sample as I do quite like it, but the performance is definitely mediocre for a parfum.Not sure if its full bottle worthy just yet. I don't think this is a very safe blind buy.UPDATE: Wearing this again and I definitely pick up more iris in the opening now. Very unique scent combined with the dark vanilla makes this one a great designer frag. But unfortunately it just does not last on me. Maybe 2 hours before its a faint skin scent. Hopefully its just my sample as I'd love a full bottle now."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"This perfume became for me a typical teenager perfume.Don't get me wrong, it's a good perfume for the first few minutes, but it became nauseating after a while. A young boy in the store I shop at , used this every day. Eventually, customers began to complain to his boss that it was simply too much and people couldn't bear to go into the store. I think he used at least 10 sprays. He was told to stop and use it at work. Especially in the summer it was bad, this is a winter perfume.Nothing for me Elexir is much better and more complex and exciting. All the ladies I've asked say the same thing"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"this is too cloying, i don't like it"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Many write that it is a master piece, maybe it is if you are 20 years old! This smells like body odor and nothing else, I've asked my friends to try it too in case it's wrong with my nose but unfortunately the answer was the same! This is definitely not a safe blind buy... I made a big mistake and now I'm sitting with a 125ml disgusting perfume that smells like sweat and burnt rubber. From me it gets 0 out of 10 I am so disappointed with this brand.An update after my review, I've left the perfume for three weeks since I bought it, the results are better, it doesn't smell as bad as when I first tried it. Now it starts to have a better aroma and more natural smell. But on the other hand, longevity is not so good yet! It lasts about 4-5 hours before it fades completely. Anyway, I'm happier that the smell has improved significantly since I first tried it. We can only hope that it develops into an even better one soon."

A must have in any legitimate collection. Really love it!"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"easily the best jpg fragrance, Its a nice woody vanilla, smells masculine and extremely smooth. This JPG is 100% better then elixir. Its toned down, more wearable and not headache inducing.This was one of my first ever favorite frags, and still is a great pick.Perfect for nights out and the winter.Highly recommend. 10/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,Believe the hype on this one! This is an all time great fragrance!
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"When you're talking mainstream this fragrance is definitely up there, but for good reason.this is my first fragrance I own from the JPG line up and I would say that this fragrance definitely catches a lot of attention, and is sophisticated enough to be appealing to those who are into fragrances as well.For me this might be the perfect fall /winter/ date night fragrance as it is rich and sweet but at the same time not too cloying (granted being mindful of over spraying). I see a lot of comments as well saying it is 'intoxicating' but I would say this is rather more ' seductively sweet'. (closer to gourmet than oriental imo)On skin it last about 5-6 hours, but on clothes last up to 8-10.performance isn't anything to write home about, but it does leave a nice trail from the 1-2 hour mark (above average).overall, fragrance is masterclass and I do not care if it is mainstream or a 'tiktok core' fragrance. 9/10"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,to me it smells just like le male but a tad bit darker and a bit stronger
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,Just truly an amazing scent. The lavender and iris is used really well in the mix with everything else. Probably my favourite from the le male line. 8.5/10
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"It's good . Smell is amazing. Lasts about 7-8 hours on my skin as skin scent . The only weak point is it's projection.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,i will miss you my beloved le male....
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,When you first put it on it smells too sweet but wait for the dry down. WOW! Too me it has a soft white musk smell thats so sexy and alluring. I can see why this mens cologne has such a high rating. Definitely a buy.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,People talk so much rubbish on here. A. This is fantastic a great take on an already extremely popular mid 90s release. B. This performs fantastically its thick and has great sillage and projection. People who talk about poor performance. ( there’s a review a few down talking about only you smelling this and poor projection). Absolute bs this performs great and is a notice me type fragrance that will have people wondering who smells so great. Definitely one that women love. This was great before the crazy hype and guess what it’s still great now. One of the best designer releases of the last 5 years. Deserves the hype and I think is great for night time use year round. The buttery iris with the fresh aromatic side and smooth vanilla is such a winning formula. Great juice. A reminder that designer done right is better than niche a lot of the time.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,The dry down is heavenly
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I’m gonna be honest on this one;Blind bought it when it came out and instantly regretted it. I actually tried liking it for weeks but had no luck until I eventually had to sell it.Don’t get me wrong it doesn’t smell bad! It just does not live up to the hype and it just seems like a watered down mixture of Elixir and/or the original Le Male.Before anyone says I’m hating on this, (even though it’d be justified) please understand that I like to keep everything real. Not saying it’s the worst, but when people say this is the best JPG I just want to gouge my own eyes out. Try searching other negative reviewsTo this day, I still find myself sniffing it sometimes as I have a 10ml sample that I rarely even touch just to give it a chance but.. it is simply just mediocre. It’s just a basic lavender and some vanilla aftershave!! It’s a shame to even call this a fragrance.I can’t put enough emphasis on how over-hyped this is by 15 year olds who post slideshows and literally glorifying it, and then others say the same thing because they can’t make decisions or opinions on their own.A rich grandpa with no fragrance knowledge who has so much money he doesn’t know where to spend it is who I’d imagine would buy and use this.It’s definitely NOT a date-night fragrance as others say… as it seems people who like this don’t really go on dates or seem to have something going on in their lives.Please stop brainwashing people into thinking this is a good fragrance 🙏Price: 3/10Longevity: 6/10Projection: 3/10 Intimate.Sillage: 2.5/10 Can’t have sillage without projectionTo me this is just a quick-and-go everyday/indoor scent. Like the original Acqua di Gio (which I actually like) but for winter.Just save your money. Or if you want a JPG buy Ultra Male or Elixir"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I wish I was a woman so I can smell it on myself.Warm spicy cardamom for the strong attention grabbing opening, a strong, sweet vanilla - lavender base to smooth out and hold everything together and a perfect balance of powdery iris which just hugs your nose. A 10/10, no doubt. That's for the scent.Now as far as projection goes, it's not great. I would call it a close quarter special. Also, the longevity is just enough; 4, maybe 5 hours, not all of which will be of full intensity.Never the less, a really great fragrance. Imperial I'd say."

Smells similar to Le Male Elixir, but less sweet and more into lavender/soft iris. Overall, a good night out fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I got this fragnance gifted to me a while ago. Its an absolute masterpiece and a must have in any fragnance collectors collection. Great beginner perfume. Its sweet, but not so that it gives you a headache. Cardamon takes the main stage with vanilla and the florals in the background. Perfect for nights not only in the winter but also summer. One of the best date fragnances that exists. Its hard to find a person that dislikes it."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,I bought a 200ml bottle of this about two years ago and have been using it a date night/ signature scent since. When I first smelled this I was immediately attracted to the creamy powdery-ness and the woody/spicey dry down which retains the powder accord from the iris. Almost out of this bottle and will probably be buying another
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"New update: since my post below. This is still giving small whiffs exactly 12 hours after application.The longevity is very good with medium to soft projection.So later in the day at the office when I thought it is to low on performance for anyone to still smell it I was surprised that two people in the office gave the scent great compliments.This looks like a silent sneaky scent trail that it leaves with you. So it does perform and is a solid fragrance.So, my final verdict is that this is bottles and bottles worthy of purchase which I plan to keep doing.This to my nose is 10/10 and a masterpiece."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I really like le male le parfum but honestly it gets glazed so much, it’s nice, it’s masculine, but the glaze is unreal"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Ok, here is the thing. I have let this sit in my draw to mature and tried it again today after 2 months.What can I say, I am literally so disappointed but in the same time I am just as much impressed and enjoying this scent equally as much as irritated by it.This smells so beautiful and pleasingly good that you keep wishing people can smell what you are smelling that literally sits next to you in a car.As I am typing this the AC of the car is on and some cool ventilation is circling in the car with my co worker sitting next to me and he cannot smell anything.So weird, I am enjoying the scent so much ALONE… and that is the thing right there with this fragrance. It is just for the person wearing it and no one else.I will be honest at this point I don’t know what to make of that reality.Why would you want to smell something so intoxicating alone?It just frustrates me so much that I don't know if this is worthy for another bottle in my collection."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"The first time I smelled it on a tester strip, I didn’t like it. However, it’s interesting how it turned out differently on my skin. Over time, it developed new layers of scent. Once the opening fades, that’s when it really starts to shine. This fragrance reaches its peak about 10 minutes after application and lasts easily over 12 hours. On clothes and objects (like a watch), it can linger for several days. The projection is a bit more restrained, but it still carries a good distance, about one arm’s length. For me, it strikes a perfect balance between projection and longevity. The price is also quite reasonable"

One of my least favourite ones in my collection. It’s not bad but I mainly use this after a shower. I wouldn’t go around recommending it but it’s okay.

Dry down smells like ultramale. This is like a toned down afnan 9pm with a weak iris on it. Very disappointed.edit: i was wrong, the opening is the best part of this fragrance, bright cardamom then dries down to a vanilla, oriental slight lavender note. This doesn’t smell like ultramale at all, but still, i do not find it pleasant."

What I get is quite the opposite - very rich opening, definitelly a well blended juice. As for the drydown I get almost nothing apart from the POWDERY IRIS. If you are not a fan of such fragrances, better avoid this one.3) Test it on your skin first! Generally this frag is not known for good projection, additionally it may not last longer than 1 hour on your skin, depending on your skin type.4) A huge compliment getter as women for some reason GO CRAZY over this fragrance.I find this perfume (at least the bottle I had) to have a similar problem as BVLGARI MAN IN BLACK - seducing 10/10 smell, 5/10 performance. It's not like I regreted buying this one, it just wasn't worth keeping it in my collection :-/7,5/10"

But after being assaulted and abused for the last five years by the likes of the Sauvage and Bleu lines, then Le Mâle Elixir, which, sorry, is just far too synthetic, sweet, and cloying, this was kinda nice to smell. It fills the niche of cool weather modern outing/smart casual/business casual wear nicely and doesn't seem to annoy anyone. If and when they fix the original Le Mâle and bring back Fleur du Mâle, we'll have a winning trio."

For those who tried this fragance and don't share the same opinion than mine, two advices: HYDRATE YOUR SKIN, BUDDY, the longevity depends on your water consumption during the day and the hydratation of your skin... Second and maybe most important advice: 2 sprays on the right and the left part of the neck, 2 sprays behind the neck, 2 spreys on each forearm (the top of the forearm) and 2 spreys each side fo your shoulder (on the cloth please), don't expect the parfum to be strong if you bought it to only apply 2 spreys total, you're wasting your money and will think EVERY PARFUM IS WEAK.Scent: 10/10Versatility: 8/10Price: 10/10Longevity: 10/10Overall: 10/10"

I'd go as far as to say I prefer JPG Le Male Le Parfum over most niche fragrances out there! Strong lavender and very masculine scent. Only critique I have of this fragrance is the fact that it's not versatile enough. The dark and sweet smell make it great for nights but overwhelming during daytime.

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,I’m a sucker for cardamom based accords. JPG Le Male Le Parfum is spell binding to me in this regard. The first time I sprayed it on myself I may have sniffed my arm a hundred times because it was so intoxicating to me. I know I had to make this my night weapon.I recently took this on my vacation and it ended up falling on the floor of the hotel I was in and the bottle broke into a million pieces and the precious juice was all on the floor. My tears mixed in with it too. The Hotel room smelled amazing - (I hated the shit eating grin the room service guys had on their faces when their olfactory senses were assaulted by this elixir when they came to clean up the bottle pieces)I went on an revenge impulsive counter buy in order to cope and ordered not one but two more bottles of this and now I’m sitting here wondering if I should order one more backup just incase someone tries to separate me from this absolute gem.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"This is a good fragrance if we are talking just about the scent, however the cardamom is just a tad bit much. If the cardamom level was lowered a tad and the iris level was increased a tad, this could have had the potential to be a great designer fragrance. But because of the high level of cardamom, this is just useful in the bedroom or on a date. For example this is not a fragrance that you could or should wear out shopping, at work, church, pretty much everything other than trying to seduce a woman. I only use this one for the same purpose as La Nuit De Lhomme or Bleu Electrique. Because of the high levels of cardamom you really cant wear those anywhere because its offensive to most people because they are not waiting around to judge you on your sexiness while you are flexing your muscles in a speedo. If you go on a date with a different woman every night, this one is for you. If you are married this can still be useful but not ideal or as appealing to use every night."

After a few minutes, the cardamom notes settle down letting the lavender and vanilla to do the action with a hint of powderyness from the iris and a little bit of woodiness in it.I know it sounded kinda simple and boring, but believe me they made it so well that if you love cardamom, then this possibly the best cardamom designer fragrance ever.Personal rating this is a 10/10 date night perfume, such a master piece from jpg."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,I used to love this when I first got it back in 2021. I never reach for it. Something about it seems unfinished. The dry down is akin to baked bread. Very yeasty. Couldn’t give it away fast enough.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,Great scent but the projection is underwhelming...
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,When I first tested it on a test strip I was underwhelmed and wondered what the hype is all about.But then I tried it again and actually used it on myself and instantly loved it. So I highly recommend trying it on yourself and not just on a test strip in a store.This scent just has something seductive and sophisticated about it. Smells lovely.My only complaint is the longevity. It either doesn't last that long or I go nose blind to it fairly quickly.
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"So I own JP ELIXIR as well. Not a bad fragrance at all. I thought it would be my favorite in the line. But, JP Le Parfum is better.What a scent this is. Wow, the dry down is one of the best I have experienced from many fragrances I own and tested.After my first proper wear I have added this to my favorite fragrance up there with Dior Homme Intense and Dior Homme Parfum.Yes this does not project heavy but it was not made for that and it never will project to fill a room.This is for romantic moments and also just for yourselves to get the most beautiful cent bubble that you don't want to stop in the dry down. It is so intoxicating.The vanilla and Iris in this is so well blended. Damn this is so good. Unfortunately it must macerate for 3-6 months now. It is a bit weak but it will mature.Can’t wait to wear this again.9/10 for this Le Male. Best in the line."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"This is a sex bomb in a bottle man. Definitely the best from the JPG line.I remember I couldn't find it in some stores so I asked the workers there to bring a tester inside the shop so some days later I could've finally smelled it. Love at first sniff for sureI bought it for discount (75ml variant).Before everything, this cologne got the best blend ever. You can't really smell each note separately so it goes to a niche classy direction. Very high qualityThe scent profile is powdery, sweet, spicy, slightly floral. Extremely seductive.Picture a grown sophisticated man who's on a first date with a woman after a long serious conversation with no childish stuff, then the girl is fascinated by him so she recommends him to spend the night together while she's screaming ""yes daddy"" to him. That's how inviting this fragrance is.Gives you shivers.The performance of this cologne is fantastic, long lasting 7-10hrs with medium projection, so you're not choking the girl during the date, specifically because of the scent.Talking about versatility, this is a date night scent. I've even worn it during a date in the summer though, for sure not recommending this during high heat. Cold weather signature, winter-fall/autumn, rainy springs too though.The iconic bottle describes this fragrance perfectly, black striped bottle with gold atomizer. Slightly dark, sexy as hell.Most balanced from the line for sureIn the top 3 of my favourite fragrances.Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male Le Parfum: sophisticated, seductive & inviting, mature, powdery sweet spicy, iconic bottle, best from the line. If you want your neck licked by a girl, this is it. 10/10"

I couldn’t stop smelling him it smelt so good that I decided to purchase my own bottle. Honestly, it might either be my batch or maybe my skin but with Vaseline this fragrance does not last long or project at all. I asked some of my friends and they said they couldn’t even smell it. This is the only fragrance in my entire collection that does this and considering the fact that this is Jean Paul gaultier and it was pretty pricey I’d definitely expect a lot better performance.

Because it still smells great but it smells different and the fades very quickly.My older bottles had great performance.

The Vanilla and iris in the background balances it out well.The performance is decent (around 6 hours on skin) with moderate projection. That said, while it's a nice perfume, I don't get the hype... It is in the realm of Prada Luna Rossa Black, LNDL, Armani Code Parfum and Valdntini Uomo Intense, but I'd never pick this over any of the aforementioned fragrances. It's nice & that's all it is... Nice enough. Will I be holding onto it as long as I can? No. Once it leaves my collection, I won't be repurchasing it. The hint of BR540 in this really puts me off as I really dislike that DNA."

A must have for anyone who loves cologne."

Fresh sprays smell like gushers but in a good way dried down you can smell the vanilla floral lavender iris goodness 10/10 colonge. There is a reason it's so hyped on tiktok"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,This is better than the Elixir to my nose. Same realm as the Armani Code Parfum; sweet iris. I'd dare say this is collection worthy for the cooler days. Excellent.

Maybe more leaning towards colder or nighttime situations but you could probably pull it off in the daytime. Love this fragrance the iris doesn’t smell like grandma or lipstick to me which is surprising. Overall very surprised at how much I like this fragrance."

The last half has had few scents ""worth"" buying. This is one of the few that on first wearing had me go ""Wow"" again. It's one of those that if you smell it up close it's OK, but when you catch whiffs in the air it's one of the best frags I've smelled. It's slightly sweet, but not cloying. The cardamom comes through in an amazing way and there's a bit of airiness the elevates the entire composition - that's the lavender I imagine. But it's blended in a way to not make any note stick out like a sore thumb. On my list to buy soon."

Am I going nose blind to this?? I don't really care if others aren't really smelling me when wearing this because I wear for my own pleasure but I'll definitely not buy another bottle if that's how it's going to perform for me.

Yes it’s not so complex with different pyramid note stages but this is what you need. Cuz not everyone is a perfume person.You could wear this Everyday all four seasons. Office/school friendly. Doesn’t have age or time limit.Projection is just perfect. Not too strong nor skin scent. Lasts around 8-10 hours.presentation is beautiful with the bottle shape.Great compliment getter.A must buy perfume either you have a collection or looking fora signature scent.Yes, this is a 9.5/10.plus it has the highest rating among all le males (4.60) on fragrantica too.Worth every penny."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"What i can respect about the Le Male flankers i've got my nose on so far is that they stick to the DNA and what difference you see in the notebreakdown is what you get. The negative about this is its hard to have your mind blown by any of them once you try a bunch and know what to expect. In the drydown they also gravitate towards the root scent profile so owning different flankers might be redundant.With Le Male Elixir, you get the original lavander + sweetness from the OG and then you see the honey note. Yep, thats what you get...Le Male with honey.In case of Le Parfum you see oriental spices and sure enough, its a spicier Le Male. Le Parfum feels a bit more grown up because of this, it doesn't combine sweet with sweet. Having said that, despite me generally being drawn to more grown up scents, i'd still pick Elixir over this. If i want a grown up scent, frankly, JPG isn't a house that comes to my mind. They are versatile, appealing and compliment getting, but they aren't mature or ""serious"" fragrances.Le Male Elixir feels more modern and going back to my point, i'd reach for a JPG fragrance if i wanted to smell hip, modern and playfull.At the end of the day, i believe JPG fragrances are hard to hate, maybe dissapointing at times due to lack of originality (again looking at you, PUIG) and i think Le Parfum is also a safe fragrance to buy."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"Pretty hard to dislike this one, it has parts of the original Le Male DNA on it, that lavander + vanilla combo that made it popular, but with added spiciness and a little bit powdery from the iris note, so it's sweet and spicy, well rounded, it has good performance and everyone seems to like it. At this point, I personally would go for Elixir but this is still a great fragrance"
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"It's good but not great. I would say it's very mass-appealing, but not necessarily very complex or interesting to a more advanced nose. I get 7-8h of longevity with a medium-soft projection. Perfect inoffensive office scent for winter. If you're looking for a very interesting sophisticated clubbing/date night fragrance, this isn't for you."

https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"I'm confused as to why people think this would compete with JPG Elixir in terms of performance. Elixir is a Parfum, JPG Le Parfum is an EDP. And because JPG never lists their alc% on their bottles, it leads me to believe they follow an averaged alc:oil ratio. Making elixir 30% oil, and Le Parfum 20-25%.Le Parfum is an iris masterpiece, along with it's competitors Prada L'homme Intense, Valentino Uomo Intense, and Dior Homme. Its iris is not too strong, but still detectable. Giving it a dark, sweet powdery-ness that allows it to be worn lightly in warmer weather without being cloying with the lavender and vanilla. I get compliments EVERY TIME I wear this out. To work, on nights out, on dates. It is very easy to go anosmic to this for some reason, I will put it on at 8am, and still get compliments 7hrs later, while it's become a skin scent to me at around the 3hr mark. Also let your bottles macerate PLEASE. If you spray a cologne and you get that initial 2 empty sprays, it means your bottle has only gone through factory maceration. It is not complete."

I just started wearing this a few days ago and have received more compliments on it than my usual go-to’s (Noir Extreme, Beau De Jeur, Prada Infusion D’Homme- discontinued) which I found very interesting. The lavender and vanilla are a timeless, delightful combination and I find myself smelling my shirt all day when I’m wearing it. My only knock is it just does not last on my skin, at all. Overall though, very good everyday scent."

The iris is done just right; I happen to be an iris lover thanks to the Dior Homme line.

Le Male2. Le Male Elixir3. Le Male Le ParfumThis fragrance is the most generic smelling of the three. This performs better than my newer bottle of Le Male but does not perform as well as Le Male Elixir. However, the scent just does stack up against the other two due to how predictable and bland it is. It is a nice fragrance but nothing more. I am not sure if I will ever get through my 125ml bottle.Anyone who describes this or Le Male Elixir as fresh, in any way, does not understand fragrance."
https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/Le-Male-Le-Parfum-61856.html,Le Male Le Parfum Jean Paul Gaultier cologne - a fragrance for men 2020,"This and Le Male Elixir, are the only fragrances that I adore in Jean Paul Gaultier fragrances. The other fragrances they offer are usually casual, youthful, and too sweet, which is why I tend to myself not to buy their fragrances, as I often lean towards other fragrances that are more mature and timeless appeal, rather than the trends.Nevertheless this fragrance got hyped by the Tik Tok, and Instagram boys. Though, in comparison, to their hype of Le Beau Paradise Gardens which is a let down for me, this, however, I thank them for it. Le Male Le Parfum and Le Male Elixir are fragrances of Jean Paul Gaultier, without being Jean Paul Gaultier. it is quite masterfully blended, it is a dark, sweet, and elegant scent like a vampire “Robert Pattinson” would wear.The hype that it got was right, and this fragrance deserves it. Amazing stuff really, the longevity is great on my skin, but the projection is soft and intimate, definitely more of a date night fragrance. If those who complains of softness of this fragrance I suggest going to Le Male Elixir or Ultra Male, if you want to be loud and attention grabbing, but if you are like me, who is subtle and preferred to be understated, and some cuddle times with your girl, this one is for you, I would also like to add, that Le Male Le Parfum, has same vibes as Dior Homme Intense. So if you are a younger gent, that dislikes mature fragrances, this one is also for you. Overall ranking; Longevity 8/10, Projection&Sillage 7/10, Scent 9.5/10.P.S: Careful around the bottle, even within the can, it still breaks…the can never protected a damn thing…feel free to test the fall damage though, highly recommended 😀👍"
